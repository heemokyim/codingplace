This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
print('world')
```

```{r}
9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1
```

```{r}
factorial(9)
```

```{r}
rep('hey my name is lee',2)
```

```{r}
plot(10, 10)
plot(c(5,5), c(10,20))
```

```{r}
plot(runif(100), runif(100))
```


```{r}
rep(times=5)
```

```{r}
object1 <- 1
object2 <- 2
```

```{r}
object1
```
