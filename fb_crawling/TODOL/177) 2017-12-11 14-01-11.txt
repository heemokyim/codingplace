	It's mentioned in the article, but it's worth considering a CPU that supports 40 lanes of PCI and a motherboard to match so that you can use 2 cards at 16x PCI or 4 cards at 8x pci.
	
	Probably not a big deal, but helps 'future-proof' you machine in case you decide to upgrade to two or more GPUs. I'm currently using two GTX-1070s. The intra-card transfer of weights is faster given that they're on 16x lanes rather than 8x lanes. It's not 2x linear performance increase, but something like 10% to 15% faster when using a data parallel model.
	
	If you ultimately want to max out your machine with 4 cards, you'll need 40 lanes of PCI anyways.
	
	If you use two or more cards, be sure to also install NCCL from NVIDIA.
