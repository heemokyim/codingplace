	Keep it evidence based and we've got ourselves a deal. Otherwise, forget it. Mere untestable interpretations of the EPR paradox have already captivated charlatans.
	

[James Paul]
	lol. what are you afraid of... genius
	

[Justin Malave]
	The continuous, dishonest, and systematic exploitation of scientific work by con-artists, looking to line their own pockets with money from the hands of the superstitious.

	He's not wrong. But does think He's some superior being lmao. Calm down malwareve
	

[Justin Malave]
	Superior being? Not in the slightest. I'm every bit as fallible as any old Joe you'd meet at the bar. I just take this stuff seriously. It's my profession, after all.

	Futurism thinks everybody will get duped by supreme skynet.
	

[Nicolay Stornes]
	According to buddhism you can get the evidence and understanding of the universe from within your self. By meditating and increasing awareness you can quiet your mind so that you can see more clearly. Worth a try, in my opinion.
	

[Justin Malave]
	There's truth in that. Any method which reduces the personal hang-ups within an individual could be wisely used in scientific observation. Heightened awareness and bias reduction would benefit any field of study, I think.
	

[Artur Kominek]
	Well makes sense. Touring believed free will had to be at the atomic level, some sort of quantum randomness i guess. Because if not... the more you study the brain, the less "free will" you find.
	

[Nathaniel Summers]
	Free will cannot be the result of rolling dice.
	

[Artur Kominek]

	If you haven't already read it, I would highly recommend "my brain made me do it" by Eliezer J. Sternberg. It goes over a lot of the neuroscience of free will... nothing really about quantum mechanics.

	If anybody believes free will, they clearly havent observed where their actions and thoughts arise from. Free will is an illusion created by the logical order of events in our brains

	No... The double slit experiment is not dependent on a conscious "observer".
	The "observation" is the act of measuring, and thanks to the genius that called it observation this simple misunderstanding has to be explained to every wishful thinker that extrapolated this as being evidence for the idea we create the reality around us.
	

[Tariq Khan]
	No. .... "observation" is not interchangeable with"measurement". I would refer you to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum phenomena and Einstein's famous words " Do you mean to tell me that the moon is not there when I am not looking at it? " According to current thinking Einstein will be shocked to know that that maybe exactly the case!
	

[Gabriel Vacariu]
	really? Empirically, quantum mechanics has great results. However, there have been various theoretical “interpretations” to QM. (See Rosenblum and Kuttner Quantum enigma - Physics encounters consciousness, 2006 or Tegmark, Max and Wheeler, John Archibald (2001), “100 years of quantum mysteries”, Scientific American, 284/2, pp. 68–75) The titles indicate exactly the “mysteries” of QM. In reality the framework of QM has been wrong all this century! My discovery of the EDWs (2002, 2003, 2005, 2006 (the first application of the perspective to the QM), 2008 (first book) and later until 2016 - Springer’s book) solved the main “QM mysteries” and other great mysteries in philosophy (of mind), cognitive neuroscience, and even biology (the definition of “life” in relationship to “organism”).
	
	The explanation of nonlocality (and many other quantum problematic notions) in my book published at Springer (Germany) in 2016. Also, see FIVE books FREE (2008-2014) at my webpage: in my works, I showed that quantum mechanics is wrong. Also, I indicated the ontology of special and general relativity. With my EDWs perspective, Einstein finally won his fight against quantum physicists! Also, in 2015, I showed that space and time cannot even exist.
	Until me, everybody has been working within the wrong framework the "world/universe". For the first time in the history of human thinking, I showed that the world (unicorn world, as I called) is a wrong notion. I discovered the “epistemologically different worlds” (EDWs). In this way, I showed that
	- the quantum problems are in fact pseudo-problems (everybody placed the wave and the particle in the same “world”/universe which does not exist
	- the mind-brain problem is a pseudo-problem (everybody placed the mind and the brain within the same world but the mind is an EW, the brain belongs to the macro-EW where are the planets).
	- Many other philosophical or scientific became pseud-problems.
	For me: (a) the “multiverse” (Physics) means that all universes are in the same macro-EW, that is, they have still worked within the unicorn world. (b) Spinoza worked within the unicorn world with one substance with “different attributes”. (c) Everybody has worked within the “universe”/unicorn world. Until me, NOBODY denied the “world”/unicorn world!
	
	the brain does not exist for the mind, the mind does not exist for the brain but both exist in EDWs:
	see this idea at SPRINGER (Germany): (2016) ILLUSIONS OF HUMAN THINKING: ON CONCEPTS OF MIND, REALITY, AND UNIVERSE IN PSYCHOLOGY, NEUROSCIENCE, AND PHYSICS, Author: Vacariu, Gabriel. Written by Springer staff:
	• “The Book delivers a new axiomatic-hyperontological framework for a non-contradictory conceptual understanding of ‘Welt’ (‘Universe’)
	• Shows how to solve fundamental and philosophical problems of Science (‘Pseudoproblems’)
	• Gives deep insight into philosophical discussions of Philosophy of Mind, Neurosciences, Psychology, Theory of Relativity, Quantum Mechanics.
	The book illustrates that the traditional philosophical concept of the ‘Universe’, the ‘World’ has led to anomalies and paradoxes in the realm of knowledge. The author replaces this notion by the EDWs perspective, i.e. a new axiomatic hyperontological framework of ‘Epistemologically Different Worlds’ (EDWs). Thus it becomes possible to find a more appropriate approach to different branches of science, such as cognitive neuroscience, physics, biology and the philosophy of mind. The consequences are a better understanding of the mind-body problem, quantum physics non-locality or entanglement, the measurement problem, Einstein’s theory of relativity and the binding problem in cognitive neuroscience.” (here: https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783658104436)
	
	In this book: the new approach regarding quantum problems, the mind-brain problem, the micro-macro problem - reality, “world”, “universe” does not even exist. Something else exist, but for what really exist, the “Epistemologically Different Worlds”. This book is a summary of the main ideas of my books (in English) published in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014 and posted at my webpage FREE (and other pages).
	• At my webpage http://filosofie.unibuc.ro/cv_gabriel_vacariu/ (Philosophy, University of Bucharest), see my article 2005 Synthese (USA) (several papers 2002-2003 on the same topic)+ five books FREE each posted on Internet when it was published) on Cognitive (Neuro)science, Physics (quantum theory and Einstein’s relativity), Philosophy (of mind), etc.
	• On Amazon, two books: Dark matter and dark energy, space and time, and other pseudo-notions in cosmology (2016) + Is cognitive neuroscience a pseudoscience (2015)
	• In book 2014 or 2016, see the ONTOLOGY of Einstein’s special and general theory of relativity within the EDWs perspective!

	Go spam your drivel somewhere else.
	

[Dave Sherrard]
	I believe, when we dream; our subconscious goes into a different dimension.
	

[Robert Nisson]
	I've theorized an ad hoc wireless biological network may exist to store information across generations. It would help bootstrap the new generation with keener instinct. Hard to test that one sans proof of dream telepathy.
	

[Sheila McClain Knight]
	Snap! I've always had such precognitive dreams that I theorized that we might time travel when we die (@ quantum entanglement) and possibly become our own ancestors such that linear time is just for cosmic reference.
	

[Nitin Kapoor]
	Hinduism talked about this thousands of years ago, and also confidently mentioned rebirths
	

[Martin Unander]
	A case of confirmation bias I see.
	

[Carrie Favretto]
	Quantum mechanics in no way supports the theory of rebirth.
	

[Drew Tyndall]
	And the Buddah said "with our thoughts, we create the world!" Monkey Magic
	

[Carrie Favretto]
	It's not our thoughts creating the world. It's called measurement and collapsing wave functions. We do it even when we don't think. Reality still exists regardless of whether or not we (and consciousness) exists. It's just that it exists in a fuzzy state of superposition.
	

[Alex Salas]
	Cristian Salas I just tag you so you have to stop what you're doing and look. Loser

	You mind is made of uncountable number of particles within and around those are a unaccountable number of quantum particles. The end.

[Jesse Hines]
	Tattoos are generally indelible designs, this is not a tattoo. This a 3d printed bacteria decal. The video did not even indicate a delivery method to the dermis, if this requires a 3d printer, it will never be a tattoo.
	

[Jesse Hines]
	3d printers are not sterile, you would never use one to shove ink under your skin.
	

[Julie Lewis]
	Infancy is the word used that comes to mind, but you're right. However the next step could be a skin graft type of evolution where an upper layer of the dermis is removed, and the hopefully sanitized decal then implanted. But we shall see, so far they have a good idea, however they need us, the rest of the village to determine its uses. Who knows how far it'll get? Kind of exciting to see how far it gets though.
	

[Jesse Hines]
	I'm more worried about complications arising from natural things, like cancer. These bacteria will have the same chances at mutation as any other cell in our body. These bacteria do not live forever so they will have to reproduce, in some form, inside our body. Add some radiation exposure and I would not want one of these in my body. I'd prefer inorganic materials be added to my body over this.
	

[Chris Hill]
	Tattoos are in the skin, not in patches on top of it.

[Melvin Damion Hilde]
	And spread disease to them earlier?
	

[Travis Hasty]
	I suppose they were greedy and warring amongst each other for land beforehand. But somehow when Europeans come along with superior technology and weaponry to be effective enough to take over exponentially large swaths of resource rich land, it's magically wrong. Got it. Seems legit.
	

[Nathanlel Sutherland]
	Pretty sure anyone using a time machine would be also be living in a world where all diseases have been cured.

	Lol. Yeah those "peaceful" Indians would have scalped you in a second.
	

[Quentin McClanahan]
	Don't worry guys... Everything's going according to plan.....
	

[Stu Munich]
	What are the implications of it?
	
	If I went back in time to alter events in my younger self's timeline so that I'd be a billionaire by the age of 18, would the older version of me that went back to help the younger version still exist? And if not then how could the older version of me go back to help the younger version if older me doesn't exist to do so?
	

[Miguel Angélus López]
	This is the tough part. Maybe you create a new universe when you travel back?
	

[Krow Neva]
	Paradoxes are so fun, aren't they?

[John David Paul Gill]
	I think if you travel back to the past you could not change anything. The past has already happened so if you don’t remember and older you telling you how to become a billionaire then that means you will never be a time traveler. Lol
	

[Terrence Long]
	Have you watch Back to the Future? I guess you need to write a reminder note and give it to your past self.
	

[Doug Michael N]
	Watch Dark on Netflix if your into time paradoxes and good long stories... you can't specifically alter your time line like that because past and present and future are all linked according to this show. More seriously though each time line has gravity...더 보기
	

[Jesse Hamilton]
	Forked timelines. This version would still happen. All you'd be doing is creating a split in the timeline resulting in a new reality. Even if the old reality ceased to exist you would probably survive because you were IN the alternate when everything changed.
	

[Jesse Hines]
	Highly doubt this is the first time you could buy "the most powerful pc gpu ever created." That benchmark is always changing.

	It reminds me of that Mitch Hedberg joke but in reverse.
	
	"Every picture is a picture of you when you were younger"
	

[Alexander Parris]
	Yup, and next year.... We'll be able to buy "the most powerful PC GPU ever" again! And the next year... again! And again and again. In fact I think every year I have bought the "most powerful PC GPU ever"... if only it stayed that way :D
	

[Bernal Allen]
	It is important to remember that the human body is a receiver of consciousness, not its generator. If this area of the brain is essential for that reception, fine.
	

[Derrick Brilliant]
	says who?

[Derrick Brilliant]
	
	

[Gary Mulcahy]
	How do you know that the brain is not a generator of consciousness?
	

[Pierre Lafrance]
	Matt Gfys Kim , I'm a physicist, and I think (!) this is BS.
	

[Andrew William Scott]
	This is the hard and soft consciousness conundrum, and we do not know which is correct. You cannot presume causation; there is not empirical data to sort either in the current canon.

[Michael Skipper]
	Maybe this work can lead to better anesthesia methods so people don't regain consciousness during surgery as well as helping revive patients in comas.
