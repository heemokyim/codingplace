We are currently able to use Artificial Intelligence to recreate the missing contents of an image. So, next time you have an old and rusty image that needs some touch-up, consider your non-human friend.

[Eugene Paul Ramirez]
	This is useful
	

[Ignacio Meza]
	Siraj raval (youtuber) just upload a quick demo of that algorithm
	

[Saikat Basak]
	No, he's using a variable auto-encoder.
	

[정용우]
	Good, it could be useful for super resolution, too.
	

[Saikat Basak]
	There are some papers if I'm not wrong.

	https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802
	

[정용우]
	Some are using a frame based RNN(they need a movie, not an image)
	

[Massimo Caccia]
	Lucas Caccia?
	

[Lucas Caccia]
	Implemented this paper I think : https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07539. Works well for datasets whose border is roughly the same (e.g. faces), not so well for high variance data like ImageNet
	

[Saikat Basak]
	Yes.
	

[Saikat Basak]
	And as pointed out, it works well with faces, not so with high variance data like ImageNet, CIFAR-100 and such.
