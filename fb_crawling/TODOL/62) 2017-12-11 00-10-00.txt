[Kjell Nace]
	To claim that the average CEO reads 60 books a year, in excess of more than one book a week is complete bullshit. If that is your best claim of marketing, well your marketing department has a serious job to do..

[Tomas Perman]
	Your right Kjell, agree

[Tomas Perman]
	What do you read?

[Kjell Nace]
	As much as possible across a variety of disciplines be it history, biography, psychology, current affairs etc. Anything that it fascinating and stretches the mind, alternatively some good fiction of the same quality.

[Vasileios Andreadis]
	It seems they dont read many books themselves after all!
	So they can be "good CEOs" of their company.

[Andrew Craig]
	Why do you say it is 'complete b*llsh*t'? http://amzn.to/2v5h90o ;-)

[Jose Miguel Nu√±o de la Rosa]
	I do agree, and there are now many online tools and resources besides books, I don't think they only read books

[Norman Chetcuti]
	It doesn't look good on CEO's. Gives the impression they haven't got much to do besides reading.

[Rob O Shea]
	Because it is complete bullshit.

[Emil Johan Oliver]
	Cary Kellogg Too be clear: Bill Gates did not read 50 books a year while building Microsoft.

[Leo Karaguezian]
	I had the exact same thought!! Unless each book is an equivalent to "My little prince" lol

[Mathys du Preez]
	The little engine that could

[Daniel Ong]
	Maybe its 60 of those picture books with few words.

[Tor N√∏rg√•rd]
	Actually Kjell it's pretty clever marketing if you think about it. By making an over exaggerated claim he triggers the human instinct to be right and prove other people wrong making thousands of people comment and share an opinion. That triggers facebooks algorithm and he gets more spred. Doobed!!! üòÖ

[Amardeep Singh]
	Thats called publicity in disguiseüòâ

[Chris Marr]
	The first thing I said to myself when I saw this was "Shite" Haha.

[Erik Dols]
	And why is an "average CEO" something to aspire to? If I ever become a CEO I want to be a great CEO. Not average.

[–í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –õ–∞—Å–∫–æ–≤]
	Tor N√∏rg√•rd and gets no conversion, because of the moronic message.

[Juwita Wisdom]

[Monty B Moriarty]
	The average CEO is more likely than the rest of the population to be a psychopath. I wouldn‚Äôt believe anything they said about books read, miles jogged, to donations to charity.

[Garth Drury]
	Agreed: the stat is so obviously BS without even assuming this was self-reported hubris by a self-selecting sample (if there was a sample)..

[Alexander Meredith]
	Yeah where the normal statistic is like 1%, in CEO's and similar people, it is 10/15%

[Ta Quoc Anh]
	Yeah !. Absolutely agree with you. We can't believe everything that they said

[Brian Russman]
	True story

[Paolo Meregalli]
	30 days and money back is ok, but ask my email to discover the cost ... is not ok. I will think when I will know the cost, without give you my email. My email address cost as your service maybe üôÇ

[Jai Shen Yeh]
	Go easy on the negativity people, 60 books a year is not something as impossible as you guys make it sound, think abt it this way, 60 books per 52 weeks, that makes it 1.15 books per week, if a book has 200 pages, u divide that by 6 days, that's 34page...Îçî Î≥¥Í∏∞

[Garth Drury]
	No-one is saying its not feasible. Just that the statement "[t]he average CEO reads 60 books a year" is without any credibility whatsoever. Snake-oil salesman tactics using unsubstantiated 'facts' to sell another me-too "miracle" life-changing course/book. Its a pity in this case, because it looks to be unnecessary.

[Jai Shen Yeh]

[Neoli Elliot]

[Mohammad Rasheed]
	Hard to believe you can read that many pages in such time 7 days a week and derive goodness from it as many non fiction and how-to books need thinking and applying to one's situation.

[Leo Karaguezian]
	DUDE!!!!...25 pages an hr of Harry potter year 1 YES!! 25 pages an hour of Immanuel Kant - Metaphysics of Morals NO!!!! Depends what you want to read (unless you want to read and understand nothing... Then yes!) And anything worth reading for me is not...Îçî Î≥¥Í∏∞

[Jeffrey B. Meyers]
	Can we please stop lionizing CEOs as our intellectual elite. Just reading a certain number of books doesn't make you smart. The more relevant questions are: what books? And, did you understand them? Self help and financial books DO NOT count. This kind of shlock is silly and anti-intellectual. Lets try to have our kids admire teachers, environmental scientists and daring journalists, not just the UBER wealthy 1% rockstar CEOs in pursuit of profit. Sorry, but this really gets in my craw. And it is TOTAL CRAP. No one reads 60 books a year unless they are a graduate student or a philosopher (unless the books are archie comics or readers digest abridged versions).

[John Hodan]
	The books have to be relevant else one just squanders ones intellectual resources acquiring much pointless useless information!!!

[Georges Kavgalakis]
	Absolutely right.
	Especially on how we must educate our kids, or which example must we give to them as parents.

[Kyle Fall]
	You seem like a cynic and not a very smart person. Lol at no one reads 60 books a year, speak for yourself buddy.

[Emi Barocco]
	I have been reading 60 books in average per year for 4 years now and yes it is more than possible. Is it easy? Now yes before was a big hard to make it as a habit. It takes practice and consistency. I read 50 pages every day and it's all it takes. We all have 24 hours a day. The question is who would you like to be as a person and what are ur goals in life. üòâ

[Stephen Lee]
	Bullshit

[Emi Barocco]
	Stephen Lee you free to think anything you would like to üòä

[Eoin Walsh]
	The average CEO didn't read 60 books a year while grinding to the top. Cause & effect don't add up in this instance. I'm doubtful of the figure proposed. A lot of top CEOs read fiction because of the empathic lessons embedded in human stories, equally valid a point. CEOs work people who work their skills, they ain't reading Tony robbins that's for damn sure.

[Daniel Tenev]
	The average idiot reads 60 books a year about how other people have seen and lived their life instead of experiencing his own life.

[Thomas Synonoma]
	Congrats on promoting ignorance.

[Carlinhos Over Drive]
	And we can see that an average of idiots live their lives commenting bullshit instead of reading a book, that is living a life.

[Mihaela Maricescu]
	I don't believe it. This means a book a week, every week, on top of their super busy office hours, schedules and trips. But I believe in (you) making a strong statement in order to switch people's habits. Apart from this, yes, reading is good.

[Percival Bueser]
	Or maybe that aren't that super busy, that's why they can manage 60 books/yr? :D

[Sadra Nur]
	The mental poverty shown by so many people on here is quite impeccable. Most people can't even get over the first sentence to take interest in the actual product. üòÇ

	the cause is the poor choice of the first sentence by scribent here.

[Anne Slater-Brooks]
	I cannot believe the comments on here. I'm no a CEO but could easily read 60 books a year. In fact I could read 100 if I set my mind to it. Those who are saying they don't have the time, maybe should get of Facebook!

[Taleb Aldris]
	The cost should be disclosed without asking for the email

[Alexander Meredith]
	They can sell your email... they can't sell nothing

[Aivan Bonafe]
	Marketing gimmick disguised as "do this to get here" while authentic paths/ideas and its extension -> companies , organizations are never, will never be reduced to a 'one approach fits all' way. Hard work can not be shortcutted.

[Di√°na Haase]
	Hmm. Reading is one of the greatest human experiences. As an adult, I feel perfectly capable of compiling my reading list, thank you. I do no think that "success" in life should be defined by comparing our habits to those of CEOs. Moreover, what a crazy idea to set such targets when it comes to reading! You know that feeling, when a book goes under your skin, and makes you pause for days.. for a week or more, not wanting to touch another one until the waves of reflections calm inside you? How could that happen if you were to rush to meet your " reading targets". It might work for some, but for me this method is just pure crap, pollluting the joy of reading, sorry.

[Mikko Lagerspetz]
	The average CEO reads no serious books. In earlier days, intelligent people read good novels and learned a lot about life and people. Now business gurus write self-help books for CEOs who have read nothing, telling them that "other people like if you show interest in them", "understanding other peoples' needs is the key to success", "some things can give your life a meaning", and so on.

[George Kolovos]

	"Only practical topics and amazing books that will have immediate, tangible impact
	(business, career, wealth, networking, leadership, influence, habit building etc.)
	Only top authors and professors who have accomplished great things in their lives."
	<end quote>
	Holy smokes!..
	The epitome of subtle arrogance with regards to "self proclaimed" knowledge of whatever reading content and context is worth, implying an underlying condescension for the remaining (overwhelmingly enlightening) scripts that have carved the minds and the various cultures of our species.
	I strongly suggest you find a rock and hide underneath it, because the message you convey is an abject one.

[Carlos Eduardo P√©rez Crespo]
	It's not only the quantity but the quality of the books you read. I see many morons saying that you have to read all that you can. Just shut up and get a good reading. It's not the same to read a Donald Trump's book and an Alexander Dumas book.

[John Paval]
	It may be that many CEOs read a lot of books, but if that did any good then corporate society, as a whole, would not be so damned resistant to constructive change and so insanely subservient to the cut throat form of capitalism which has become progressively more and more savage over the last thirty years. The last head of GE has written famously about how he was incapable of getting things done in his own organization.... Seriously, where is the intelligence in that kind of "leadership"?

[Avaah T Skae]
	World needs not only successful people but happy, vibrant and passionate, who know ho to love. This chase game for more and more is not working

[Jason Wood]
	There's a credibility red flag in your first sentence.
	The rest of your copy is kind of a mess.
	
	Not sure exactly what you do or why you're qualified to do it.
	Something about books and business.
	
	Honestly, I only clicked the 'read more' to see if there was any clarification. Not usually a great motivator for click throughs. heh. I never considered visiting the link.
	
	Sounds like you need a few more drafts and maybe have the managers take a back seat in the writing process.
	
	Hope that was a little bit helpful
	Good luck in the future

[Nikolina Bratchkova]
	Nice try. Big business decisions are made around the table, in some posh brothel, the business owners striking the deal drunk. Owners, unless being CEOs themselves, hire CEOs to implement. These people have read probably 100 books in their entire lives, and their skills are not learned at schools and universities. They were born like that. Well, reading may help, but drinking with the right people, and hiring clever guys to to the reading and give them the headlines only, does the job. Of course, exceptions exist only to prove the rule.

[Christian Roach]
	Just for the LOLz
	
	So yeah - I read 47 books last year, 45 the year before and I've already read 42 this year. I'm no CEO but one of the skills I've learned is how to speed read, another is to chunk.
	
	The CEO's I know read voraciously, whether that's 60 books a year, only they really know but they read a lot, a lot of them anyway. If you learn to read efficiently, the average London commuter can read just under a book a week based on a two hour travel time per day, if you live somewhere else then it may be different.
	
	The claims may be exagerrated but then again they may not, who really gives a fuck about the exact number? It's clever marketing and it got some naysayers attention which can only be a waste of naysayers time, not anyone else.
	
	If you know how to read well, 60 books a year is more than attainable. What else are you going to do on all those long haul flights and commutes anyway.

[Knut Ivar Karevold]
	It is a sign of immaturity to read too many books. Many of the right answers can be found in just a few books. CEOs can have great impact if they attend to their hearts and start caring for their people and how their business contributes to the greater good of the world. Too many books function as intellectual distractions, pulls CEOs into an intellectualized reality without real connections to what actually is important. Knut Ivar - Psychologist

[Richard James]
	For some reason this crazy ad keeps popping up on my FB feed. It's a scam as far as I can see and everyone should start complaining to FB about it

[Percival Bueser]
	60 is a "suspiciously round" number. If it were 59.7 or 47.5, though....
	
	Anyway, I'd credit you for making claims about the "average" of a reference group, instead of about the "exceptional" ones in such reference group. Not many advertisers would do that. Maybe the exceptional ones aren't too exceptional? :P

	Little known fact- last year the CEO of a major corporation read 50 Shades Darker, Haynes Manual for the Ford Focus (1998-2004) and Where's Wally in 1 week!

[Stephen Lee]
	I once travelled for a year and managed to read 46 books. I had no job and loads of time on my hands. There is no way I could have fitted in heading up even a modestly successful part time freelancing business. I thus declare this ad to be bullshit.

[Luise Wilson]
	Appreciate you are encouraging business folk to read and improve themselves but could you let me know where you got your statistics from since only 1 of my past 3 CEOs has opened anything other than an email... my current CEO would be grateful for this if I can sling a fact at him to back it up

[Patchimo Patamo]
	Total bullshit! A good CEO has a vision, more likely to be deep rooted in case he has Culture, which means having read a lot of book which have nothing to do with business. Does not mean from time to time a business related book is not worth it, especially about changes occurring on the planet. Et voil√† üòé

[Anita Grace MacDonald]
	I used to read approx 4 books per day (no television), but nowadays reading is lots of sites, blogs, info etc so I don't really believe this stat sadly

[Anton Nadilo]
	Knowledge is not power! Nor are learners the big earners. It is the ability to apply that knowledge in a value add manner that make a good CEO worth their salt.
	
	Reading 60 books a year and doing nothing with that knowledge makes you just a stupid as before you started.

	'Average CEO reads 60 books per year'.. you went a bit too far with that. On a positive note though, reading is good. Great start up as no active person has time to read books in full nowadays.

[Philippe Segers]
	Who ever meet one CEO that read so much ? I‚Äôve been n-1 or n-2 of many CEO in my career and never meet one. Not statistically sound but enough for me for not buying it...

[Daniel Faden]
	Well... If they read 5 books per month. Roughly one per week. Either they are really short, either they are really simple... How many books per year does a CEO understand but reading...?

[Dan Mozartino]
	You hardly need to finish reading them all. You should definitly not read them all. Only 10% is really important. The art of picking up the essential in a book is what really matters. Now go away, do not read this until the end, what really matters is above.

[Sompob Pordi]
	Imagine following dialogue in a board meeting:
	Members of The Board: Last year we missed both revenue and ebitda targets. And yet, you are proposing extra investment with neither commitment on return nor indication of profitability turnaround?
	CEO: I read 61 books last year.
