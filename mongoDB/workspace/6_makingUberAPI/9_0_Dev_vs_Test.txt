What if we formerly created DB
and after that, running test,

test helper will wipe out collections in DB
If existing DB is needed, it can be huge issue.

So how can we deal with this?
==> Separate two databases by 'NODE_ENV'

------------------------------------------------------
npm run test
"test": "NODE_ENV=test nodemon --exec 'mocha --recursive -R min'"
