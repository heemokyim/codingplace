* what if require's file doesn't exist but folder ?
== find index.js in that folder

ex) var greet=require('./greet')
greet/index.js

*.json?
= one of file-formats
= isn't JS but text
= JS read json file and convert it into JS object

object-literal representation between JS and JSON

*JS
{
	first:... ,
	last:...
}

*JSON
{
	"first":... ,
	"last":...
}

* don't need to put .js in require path

* require function caches result
== the wrapped script code for require only run once
including module.exports

ex) var greet = require('./greet3')
	var greet1= require('./greet3')
	greet and greet1 point same object
	
* In JS for exports and module.exports
assignment to variable = making new spot in memory
assignment to object   = pointing same spot in memory

also, exports and module.exports are same
and because of quirk about upper,
just use module.exports!
