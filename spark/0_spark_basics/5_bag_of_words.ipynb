       " \"But no matter how much advice or how many stories I give you, in the end success relies on your own preparation, planning, skillset, talents, determination, and a little bit of luck. I can't give all of that to you.\",\n",
       " 'If this book gives you the confidence to strike out on your own � that�s great. But do it responsibly, and realize that failure is a very real possibility that you must plan for.',\n",

       " 'PREFACE',\n",
       " 'Three years ago, I worked for a big company.',\n",
       " 'I did everything a good American employee is supposed to do. I worked hard. I devoted all of my thoughts to making this big company even more successful. I commuted an hour each way, without complaint. I worked 50 hours every week at a minimum. And when I got home, I let them page me at 2 AM if something needed my attention � which happened pretty often.',\n",
       " 'Over the years, I was rewarded with more responsibility, and more money � although it never seemed to be quite enough. I was considered a role-model software development manager, and I felt successful. ',\n",
       " \"At home however, my marriage was under stress, my kids hardly knew me, and I was on prescription sleep aids in order to combat the extreme stress I was under. My family wasn't happy living in the part of the country we lived in, and they weren't happy with me. But, all that felt secondary to my duty to my employer, and my duty as a provider for my family. I was doing what I thought I had to do.\",\n",
       " 'Three years ago, I was faced with an ultimatum from my family � it was my job, or them.',\n",
       " \"A few weeks later, I quit my job. I walked away from about a million dollars� worth of stock grants in doing so, and I wasn't happy about it. \",\n",
       " 'But, I made the decision to try working for myself before seeking another traditional job.',\n",
       " \"Today, I run my own software company out of my home. I have no employees to worry about, and a revenue stream that matches anything I ever made as a successful senior manager at a big tech company. I now live someplace with a lower cost of living, I don't eat out as much, and I have no commuting costs to deal with�  so I get to keep much more of that money.  My entire family is happy, and we're closer than we've ever been.\",\n",
       " \"I don't worry about money anymore. I don't worry about my career growth, or about saying the wrong thing to some executive. I have no commute and no meetings. I don't have to be in the office at 9 AM, nor have any artificial requirement to work a set number of hours each day, or each week. I don't write or receive performance reviews. I never have to fire anyone. Nobody can fire me, and nobody can lay me off.\",\n",
       " \"I don't take sleep aids any longer, because my stress level is basically zero. I'm 43 years old, and I'm pretty sure this is what retirement is supposed to feel like �  except I'm not too old to enjoy it, and I'm not broke.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not telling you this to gloat. I'm telling you this because maybe you're like I was three years ago. Maybe some part of you knows that your only reward for your hard work is going to be a heart attack in a few years, but you feel trapped by your salary and your responsibilities. You've accepted society's expectations of focusing entirely on your work until you're 65 or so, at which point you hope you'll have enough money saved to actually retire, and enough health left to enjoy it.\",\n",
       " \"I'm here to tell you there is another path. Taking it isn't easy, but success means personal and financial freedom that you never knew was possible.\",\n",
       " \"This book tells you how I did it, while minimizing the risks to my family in the process. It shares what I've learned along the way. You don't have to be rich to do this, and you don't need to be a software developer. But if you have the smarts and tenacity to be self-sufficient, read on � it may just save your life, in more ways than one.\",\n",

       " 'The first step toward self-employment is to want it.',\n",
       " \"If you've spent your entire professional life working for someone else, self-employment is a very scary proposition. The life you have is familiar and comfortable, and the easiest thing is to just continue along your current career path. Discarding that career and striking out on your own is a bold thing to do. Your psyche is going to rebel against a change of this magnitude, and find ways to justify not trying it.\",\n",
       " \"It's therefore not surprising that many self-employed individuals were forced into their situation. The ones that become successful on their own talk a lot about the personal freedom they enjoy as a result, but seeking personal freedom is not what motivated them to achieve it. According to the 2012 Freelance Industry Report, 29% of freelancers fell into their self-employment by necessity, after being laid off or downsized.\",\n",
       " \"It's better to transition into self-employment on your own terms. If you start planning and set up your new business before you quit your day job, you can ensure you have income flowing from the first day you start working for yourself. This book will arm you with the details you need to make that happen, but first you need to decide if this is an effort worth taking.\",\n",
       " \"Before we talk about how to become self-employed, I want you to understand the forces working against you. I want you to come to terms with them, and I want you to understand the reasons why it is worth the effort to overcome them. That's what the first part of this book is about: understanding the barriers to self-employment, both real and imagined, and understanding why self-employment is still a goal worth pursuing. When we're done, we'll do a self-assessment to see if you're really in a position to take the leap into self-employment.\",\n",
       " 'FEAR OF FAILURE',\n",
       " 'Your paycheck puts food on the table and a roof over your head pretty reliably. The idea of giving that up quickly brings up images of your family starving and your house getting foreclosed. This is a real risk, but with proper planning and educated decision making, it�s a risk you can minimize.',\n",
       " 'If you have responsibilities at home, you should not quit your day job until:',\n",
       " \"* You've got a financial safety net in place, and hard and fast rules as to how low you're willing to let those reserves get before returning to the workplace\",\n",
       " '* You have a plan for getting another job if you need it',\n",
       " \"* You've already prototyped your business on the side and proven it is viable\",\n",
       " \"So, you're going into this with an upper bound on what you're willing to lose before calling it quits. Worst case, you learned a few things along the way.\",\n",
       " \"But just how risky is entrepreneurship? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the US Small Business Administration (SBA), 50% of all new businesses survive at least five years. A third of new businesses survive ten years or more. Now, think about how long you expect your current job to last. Would you say there's more than a 50% chance your employer will still be around five years from now, and you'll still be working for that same company? The Bureau of Labor Statistics has that answer as well. The average job tenure in the US in 2012 was only 4.6 years. \",\n",
       " 'Does starting your own business seem that risky now?',\n",
       " 'Here\\'s another statistic � the 2012 Freelance Industry Report shows that only 22% of freelancers feel less financially secure than when they were an employee. 28% \"strongly agree\" they are better off financially working for themselves, and 29% \"moderately agree.\" Freelancers don\\'t represent all of the self-employed, but it\\'s always an option for you.',\n",
       " \"22 million Americans were self-employed in 2010, representing 14% of the workforce. It's not a fringe thing to do. They range from housekeepers, to construction workers, to web developers, to doctors. You don't need a fancy education and lots of professional connections to make this work � but if you have them, think of the advantage you'll have over the millions who managed to make it work without them. You don't need a full time employer to earn a living.\",\n",
       " 'CAREER INDOCTRINATION',\n",
       " \"So, why do you spend most of your waking hours working as hard as possible to make somebody else richer? Well, being raised your entire life to believe that is a worthy goal has a lot to do with it. We'll talk about external barriers to self-employment later, but the biggest barrier is probably internal � you believe self-employment is just not what you're supposed to do!\",\n",
       " 'Indoctrination is a strong word, usually reserved for religious cults and brainwashing. But, it just means being taught a set of beliefs without questioning them. Just how much do you question the idea that you must have a job in order to be a responsible member of society? One common means of indoctrination is to instill ideas into youth before they are old enough to question them, and have the ideas come from people in authority. That�s precisely what happened as you grew up, pushed along a track into a corporate job.',\n",
       " 'When you were in school, you were probably told by your parents and teachers to get good grades so you could get into college. In college, you were told to work hard so you would get a job after you graduated. And if you were lucky enough to get that job, you were absorbed into training and a culture that promotes loyalty to your employer. It�s the end result of a lifestyle choice that was indoctrinated into you at an early age.',\n",
       " \"Once you landed in the professional world, you worked hard in order to get your next promotion, or to just not get fired. You've been so busy following this path, that you haven't had time to even consider the alternatives. Meanwhile, you've probably picked up some new responsibilities like children, a mortgage, or student loan debt � and so the idea of giving up a steady paycheck seems terrifying, even if it's barely enough to meet your financial demands.\",\n",
       " \"If you've got bills to pay and mouths to feed, having a job is just what you do. You probably don't look forward to going to work in the morning � hardly anyone does. But you try to make the best of it, and fulfill the responsibilities life has thrust upon you � year after year. You hear about people starting their own businesses, but you think it's just way too risky for someone who has responsibilities beyond buying their next foam cup of Ramen noodles. You�ve developed what is known as �learned helplessness� � you aren�t happy with your stressful career, but you believe it is the best option available to you.\",\n",
       " \"You may think you're trapped in your career, but you're not. As with breaking any indoctrination, the first step is to understand how you got there, and develop the desire to see alternate paths. Striking out on your own and becoming self-employed is one such path that can improve your lifestyle, when done responsibly.\",\n",
       " 'THE CARROT ON A STICK',\n",
       " \"You've worked hard to get where you are in your career.  You probably believe you're just one more promotion away from a bigger paycheck that will change your lifestyle. Or all those shares of stock you've been awarded in your company are really going to pay off big one day. Why would you quit, and throw all of that away?\",\n",
       " 'Question the rewards your career is promising you, and compare them to the rewards you could achieve on your own.',\n",
       " \"If you�re working hard toward your next promotion, there are several questions you should ask yourself. Do you trust your current manager to give you that promotion, and to give you a pay increase commensurate with the increased responsibilities and stress that come with it? Do you really believe you'll win out from all of the other people struggling to get that same promotion? Are you that sure you're better than all of your other co-workers, and have a better relationship with your management than they do? The corporate career world is a zero-sum game in the end, no matter how you spin it.\",\n",
       " \"If you�re banking on equity that you have vesting in your employer�s company, ask yourself these questions: Do you trust the stock market with your net worth? Do you believe your hard work impacts your employer's bottom line to the degree that you materially affect its stock price, and the value of any equity you have in the company? Do you really believe that investment bankers will behave rationally, and reward good long-term behavior from your company? Are you working for a startup, and working almost exclusively for a tiny slice of the proceeds if your employer turns out to be a one-in-a-hundred acquisition success?\",\n",
       " 'If you�ve answered those questions honestly, you�ll see that the rewards you�re working toward are actually a pretty big gamble. You may be staying in your career out of risk-aversion, but in reality your career is a pretty risky thing, without high potential rewards.',\n",
       " \"As hard as you've worked for your employer, your employer has also worked to find ways to keep you motivated while spending as little cash as possible in the process. What do you consider a good annual raise? 3%? What sort of pay increase do you expect with a promotion? 10%? Are those stock awards really worth anything, or do they have such a long vesting schedule that they only serve to keep you around? If you�ve ever wondered if you�re just chasing the proverbial carrot on a stick, there�s a good chance you are.\",\n",
       " 'If you don�t get that promotion or that big raise, you�ll be told it�s because you didn�t work hard enough, or weren�t smart enough, compared to your peers. You might start doubting your own abilities and either work harder or accept less for your work as a result � which is precisely in your employer�s best interests, but not yours. All that time, however, you may have thrived working for yourself. I�m a case in point � my own corporate career hit a dead end when I had difficulty getting promoted to a Director-level job, but today my company earns more than a Director would. By focusing my efforts on building my own company instead of the self-promotion and lobbying required to achieve corporate career growth, I ended up both earning more and creating more.',\n",
       " \"Let�s quantify that carrot of yours. Let�s say 10% annual growth in your income sounds like a good year to you. If you're running your own small company and it only grows 10% in a year, you should be asking yourself what you're doing wrong. The rewards your employer offers you are intentionally limited � in part to minimize their expense, and in part to prevent pay inequities.\",\n",
       " \"When you work for yourself, there is no upper bound to how much more money you can earn every year. And, it's entirely under your control � you are not dependent on a manager to decide you are worthy of that reward. The market rewards you based on the quality of your products and the demand for them, end of story.\",\n",
       " \"Let me state that again, as it's a very important point � there is no upper bound to what you can make when you are self-employed. There's also no lower bound (other than zero), but with careful planning you can mitigate that risk and choose the lower bound you're willing to accept.\",\n",
       " \"Face it � you�re not going to get rich working for someone else, unless you have the connections to get into the C-suite. You might think that's attainable, but the odds are very much against you. You have much better odds of attaining significant wealth working for yourself. I�m not promising to make you a millionaire � but even a much smaller number can ensure you no longer worry about money. More importantly, the freedom that comes with self-employment means you�ll have time to enjoy the experiences that money can buy. \",\n",
       " 'EGO PROTECTION',\n",
       " \"If you're successful in your career, you probably feel pretty good about that. Everyone wants to be liked and respected, and a corporate job can give you that. You've probably formed some close personal bonds to some of your co-workers � working alongside others in stressful situations has that effect. It can be a hard thing to give up.\",\n",
       " \"When you start your own company � guess what, you're now a CEO. And a president. And whatever else you want to call yourself. Your friends won't think less of you; they'll probably respect you even more for having the guts to do it.\",\n",
       " \"Yes, you will lose a lot of daily face to face interaction with people. But in this day and age of social media, it's easy to stay connected with your friends. It's been three years since I quit my job and moved 3,000 miles away � but I don't think I've lost a single friend in the process. Successful self-employment will also require you to meet new, like-minded people � and if that's not enough, there are probably multiple Meetup groups you can join filled with local entrepreneurs, or people who share your other interests. Work out of a coffee shop or shared co-working space if you really need people around you all the time; the cost is minimal.\",\n",
       " 'In your current career, your ego is probably tied to your accomplishments at work. Think about your current goals at work � how much impact do they really have on the world, or on your life outside of work? Think about how much better it would feel to create something big on your own, that you can take full credit for! ',\n",
       " 'YOUR EMPLOYER AS A SECURITY BLANKET',\n",
       " \"Your employer probably takes care of a lot of things for you. They withhold taxes from your paycheck so you don't have to think about them much. They arrange for your health insurance. They contribute toward your Social Security and Medicare taxes. They pay unemployment insurance. They might contribute toward dental, vision, or life insurance as well. Someone else probably deals with all the licensing, legal requirements, and accounting associated with your employer, so you can focus on a very narrow job. That's a lot of stuff you don't need to worry about. You've got enough to worry about already, right?\",\n",
       " 'When you work for yourself, you do need to arrange all of these things for yourself. And not only do you need to build a great product or service yourself, you also need to do all the stuff other people did for you at a big company. You need to be a PR specialist, a marketer, an accountant, a website developer, a manager, and a paralegal depending on the day. In all honesty, it can seem very intimidating at first.',\n",
       " \"In reality, arranging insurance for you and your family is a hassle, but it's something you just have to take care of once a year. It's not that big of a deal. Maybe you have a working spouse, and you can just switch to another company's benefit plan as a result. If so, that's super easy and the cheapest way to go by far.\",\n",
       " \"As for all the other hats you need to wear when you're self-employed � the important thing is to understand what you're not good at, and hire others to do them for you. Need a website for your new business and you don't even know what CSS is? Find a contractor to build it for you. Similarly, there are freelance marketing and PR professionals out there you can lean on as needed. You're going to need an accountant and a lawyer anyhow; the trick is just to use them wisely. You don't have to go it alone in everything � although the more you can learn yourself, the less you'll need to spend on others.\",\n",
       " 'Many areas also have business incubators funded by local governments. Unlike venture capital business incubators, these resources simply provide help to local small businesses in hopes that they will grow and create more jobs in the long run. They often provide free advice and free access to local experts in the areas you need to run your business effectively, and you should take advantage of them.',\n",
       " \"Yes, there are many new things you'll need to learn and take care of when you're self-employed. That's part of what makes it exciting! And there is help all around you, if you just look for it.\",\n",

       " \"90%. Think about that for a minute. 55% say they would never even consider going back to work for someone else again. You rarely hear about the potential rewards of self-employment � let�s talk about why it's worth taking this leap.\",\n",
       " 'UNLIMITED GROWTH POTENTIAL',\n",
       " 'If you understand how to create a business that can scale independently from your own time, then your business has unlimited growth potential. Unlike your corporate job, there is no upper bound on your earnings, and there is a direct relationship between your efforts and the money you make. Once you have created a product to sell, you may sell as much of it as you can to create an ongoing stream of revenue. This is called passive income, and it�s a beautiful thing. The more products you and your contractors create, the more revenue streams you have. The more time you invest in marketing, sales, and finding new markets, the more you�ll sell of the products you have. There is no limit to the number of products or sales you can achieve.',\n",
       " 'Often, there is a disproportionate relationship between your effort and the rewards. One year, I increased my business by 50% just by being smarter about my online advertising. It took about a week of my time to achieve that. Could a week of effort result in a 50% pay raise in your current job? I thought not. Another year, I doubled my business by launching a new product. It took a few months of dedicated effort, but it effectively gave me a 100% pay raise that year � and it continues to grow and sell more every year. As long as I have new ideas and new ways to market and promote my products, I have every reason to believe that growth will continue over the long run.',\n",
       " 'When you work for yourself, you are forced to look at every minute you spend through the lens of \"how will this activity create more ongoing revenue?\" If you devote yourself full time to such endeavors, you are the direct beneficiary of the business growth that results.

You may want to increase or decrease that estimate, depending on the employment market for people with your particular skills and experience.

Don't make the mistake of adding up your basic living expenses such as rent, your cell phone bill, etc. You probably spend a lot more every month than you realize, and no matter how much you tell yourself you can just tighten your belt and spend less for a while, in reality that's much harder to do than you think. Instead, go get your last 6 months of bank statements, and figure out how much you actually spend on average every month.

Venture capitalists want young, energetic founders who will happily work for next to nothing � and they seem to like founders that remind them of themselves in college.

       " 'The astute may say, \"Only one in ten startups survive? Didn\\'t you say earlier in this book that half of all new businesses last five years or more?\" I did. Both statements are true � but most businesses are not startup \"growth businesses.\" They are lifestyle businesses.',\n",
       " 'A startup business is designed to grow fast, above all else. In contrast, a lifestyle business exists for the sole purpose of providing revenue and freedom to you and your family over the long run.',\n",
       " \"All those family-owned restaurants, barber shops, pool cleaners, landscapers, roofing companies, freelancers, and people selling crafts or imported goods online are running a lifestyle business. Their objective is not to grow into a company that employs thousands of people, or to get acquired by Google for billions of dollars. Their goal is to simply do what they love to do on their own terms, and earn enough money doing it such that they can enjoy life and some freedom. You rarely hear about how these companies come to be, but you're surrounded by them all the time.\",\n",
       " \"This is a much more attainable goal. You don't need to be a landscaper or a restaurateur to do it; there are even better options � ones that don't involve the responsibility of hiring and managing others, or being tied to a single physical location.\",\n",
       " 'PLANNING THE IDEAL LIFESTYLE BUSINESS',\n",
       " \"When planning for a new lifestyle business, we want to maximize all of the benefits of self-employment we discussed earlier. Your business should be designed to do so from the start. Let's review those benefits, and how your business can realize them to their fullest.\",\n",
       " \"Unlimited growth potential. Your business should create products that can create an ongoing revenue stream with minimal further investment of your own time. Your time is limited, and a business that can only grow with the time you put into it cannot scale. A freelancer's business cannot scale beyond that freelancer's available time; but building a marketplace for freelancers can. The ideal situation is to create digital products with some time up front, which can then sell themselves indefinitely through online purchasing and distribution, completely automatically. Even your marketing can be largely automated through targeted online ads and building a website optimized for conversions. Physical products can work the same way, if you can outsource the production and distribution of your product at a reasonable cost.\",\n",
       " \"Investing in yourself, not someone else. You want to avoid the need to take on investors or debt in order to start your business. Instead, create a business you may bootstrap using the time and money you have available while you're still employed. Investors generally are not interested in funding a lifestyle business anyhow � they want a slice of a big payoff at the end, and have no interest in your lifestyle. Bank loans for small businesses are difficult to come by these days (unless they are backed by collateral), which really only leaves bootstrapping and crowd-funding as options anyhow. This is all for the best, however. Self-funding your new business means that you have no investors who can demand that you do things their way, and it means that the profits from your business are entirely your own going forward. The good news is that many modern businesses do not require a large cash outlay up front � often, all you need is a website, a computer, and an Internet connection � plus that financial safety net we talked about earlier.\",\n",
       " \"No dependencies. Think about what or who your new business will depend upon for success. Of course, you'll depend on your customer base � but are there other dependencies outside of your control that could get in your way? A good example is a company that relies on government contracts. Will you get paid the next time Congress forces the government into a temporary shutdown? Do you know all of the arcane paperwork and regulations that are required in order to actually get paid by the government in a timely manner? Do you know how long it takes for a government contract to get awarded before you receive a penny from it? There's a lot in this example that's outside of your control, which can absolutely kill a new business that's starting out. A more common problem is relying on suppliers for your business that may not be able to deliver what you need on time or to your specifications. If you�re selling stuff that other people provide, make sure you have a pool of potential suppliers to use in case one doesn�t work out.\",\n",
       " \"Freedom to work where you want. If your business requires physical interaction with people, you're thinking too small. By tying yourself to people in a specific location, you are both giving up some freedom and limiting your growth potential. Instead of planning to open up a beauty salon for local individuals, consider selling beauty products on the Internet to people around the entire world all at once. Then, if your business becomes successful, you have the freedom to move to Tahiti without losing a single customer in the process.\",\n",
       " \"If freedom from commuting and freedom of location are important to you, it's also important to plan a business that does not involve hiring employees that require your physical oversight. As your business grows, can you start hiring freelancers and independent contractors remotely to help out? Can you outsource much of what you do? If so, that's a business that can scale beyond your own time and one that offers the most freedom. If your business is such that you must hire people that require face-to-face management in order to grow, then you're going to find yourself tied to an office where you must be physically present at least as long as your employees are. You're giving up a lot of the benefits of self-employment in that case.\",\n",
       " 'No commute. One of those benefits is not dealing with a daily commute, and reclaiming those hours of your life. If your customers are all concentrated inside the city, you live in the suburbs, and your product is such that you need a physical presence with your customers � you�re doing it wrong on many counts. First of all, the fact that you require a physical presence with your customers violates the first tenet of \"unlimited growth potential\" � you can only make as many sales as you have time to see your customers physically. Maybe you\\'re a contractor who must be at a client\\'s office you must commute to � but again, such a business cannot scale beyond the time you have available. ',\n",
       " 'Freedom to work when you want. Yet again, this comes back to the theme of not creating a business that requires face-to-face contact with your clients. If your business is one such that you supply products, not services, to customers � then as long as you respond to their messages within a day, they will generally be happy. You can choose to batch up all of those messages and handle them in the same hour every day, or respond to them throughout whatever window of time you decide to dedicate to your work. But when that is remains up to you, and you have the flexibility to change it as needed.',\n",
       " \"Avoiding employees, or contractors who require close supervision, is also required to let you manage your time as you see fit. If you have someone working for you from 9-5 that isn't experienced enough to work independently, then you too need to be available from 9-5. If you aren't, you'll have someone wasting their time figuring stuff out on their own, or doing things incorrectly, and still sticking you with the bill for that time.\",\n",
       " \"Freedom to work how you want. A big part of why you're considering self-employment is because you want to be your own boss. But certain kinds of businesses afford more creative freedom than others. As mentioned earlier, freelancing is a good way to keep paying the bills during the early stage of your business, but as a freelancer you're just trading your old boss for a bunch of new ones: your clients, who all want things produced to their exact specifications. Working for a client as a freelancer isn't all that much different than being an employee, except you probably don't have to go to as many meetings, and you're hopefully paid more per hour to compensate for your lack of benefits.\",\n",
       " \"I will again caution against taking on investors, even it's from Uncle Bob or Mom & Dad. As soon as someone other than you has a financial stake in your endeavor, they will probably want some ability to call the shots. It may be well-meaning advice, but if their money is on the line, you can bet they expect you to act upon it. Free advice, without strings, is easy to get � you don't need investors for that. This is why I advise starting your business before you quit your day job, if at all possible. Choosing a business that does not require a large cash outlay up front can make that possible. \",\n",
       " \"My advice so far is admittedly self-centered. I'm telling you to avoid hiring people, avoid involving investors, and avoid creating a business that depends on strong ties to your local community.  This might go against everything you've been taught all your life about being a good member of the community. If you want to remain tied to that community indefinitely and have your schedule revolve around them, that's fine. Perhaps creating local jobs and new, deeper relationships with members of your community is in fact what motivates you. I won't stop you. Just understand what you're giving up � if your business takes off, you're still going to be tied to a local office working 9-5. You won't have the option to up and move someplace warm and work whenever you want to, without the need to sell your company or to give up its revenue stream. Working out of a beachside caf� in Hawaii a few years from now will be how your story ends, only if you craft your business with that end in mind. To maximize your personal freedom, your business must be portable, global, and avoid full-time employees that cannot be easily replaced or managed remotely.\",\n",

So, let me give you the story of my own company, Sundog Software LLC, and how it was designed to maximize the advantages of self-employment. In all honesty, \"designed\" might be too strong of a word � a lot of it was lucky choices. But you can learn from how it worked out.',\n",
       " \"Sundog Software specializes in real-time computer graphics software for environmental effects. Think of skies, clouds, and oceans in video games, training simulators, and the like. It's a niche, but it's something I enjoy and do well. I license my software to companies like big defense contractors, aerospace companies, flight simulator enthusiasts, and game developers. Today it earns over $300,000 per year in revenue, and the vast majority of that is profit.\",\n",
       " \"It has unlimited growth potential, because after developing this software, I'm able to sell it to as many people as I want to without investing significant additional time. I do need to fix bugs and keep my products modern, but those efforts are shared with all of my customers at once. There is no linear relationship with my number of customers and the number of hours I need to work.\",\n",
       " 'My software is a digital product, so I have no costs for manufacturing or shipping to deal with. Customers all over the world can order software licenses on my website with a credit card, at which point they automatically receive a download of their product. Online advertising campaigns seek out new customers and direct them to my website automatically. Prospective customers may obtain product information, demos, and trial versions from my website without interacting with me at all. I literally earn money while I sleep.',\n",
       " \"I started developing this software as a hobby, while I was still working in a conventional job. Since it's something I enjoy, it didn't really feel like work. But I soon realized that what I made had commercial value, and I started offering it for sale online at a low price just to test the market. I used some bonus money to pay a web designer to develop a WordPress-based storefront for my new product, and quickly earned that money back.\",\n",
       " 'Note that I was careful to review the terms of my employment at the time. They were remarkably generous with regards to side endeavors such as this. Still, I was careful to only work on this using my own time and equipment. If you aren\\'t careful about this sort of thing, you could end up with your current employer laying a claim to whatever you created on your own, or being upset about your \"moonlighting\" enough to put your day job in jeopardy. Even though I knew I was playing by the rules in my case (and it was actually helping to keep my technical skills up for my day job), it\\'s still not something I talked about much at work.',\n",
       " 'The important point is that I did not take out any loans or outside investment to get a proof-of-concept product into the market. I did it on my own time, with my own money, while I still had a steady source of income. This way, I was only investing in myself � the company that resulted was entirely mine.',\n",
       " 'By the time I was forced to leave my day job due to personal circumstances, even the 10 hours or so per week I was devoting to my little \"hobby\" was resulting in almost enough revenue to live off of. I had enough saved up to cover living expenses for a few months, and I could afford to provide my own health insurance for a while. So, I took a gamble that with a full-time effort, I could grow this business into something my family could live comfortably from.',\n",
       " 'I started off doing a lot of freelance work as a software developer, and found that with my professional connections and the demand for experienced software engineers, it was surprisingly easy to come by. I was also surprised to find that nobody even blinks at paying $150 per hour for an experienced software engineer. My paranoia about depleting my savings and having to seek a new job went away pretty quickly. But I was still working hard to meet the high expectations my clients had, so in many ways it still felt like I had a job, and not a business.',\n",
       " \"At the same time, I was investing just as much time into growing Sundog Software. I worked to optimize my automated targeted marketing through Google AdWords and display ads on specific websites. I raised my prices after evaluating the market. I started sending press releases out to publications my customers read, which doesn't cost anything. I started building up an email list and sending out regular newsletters. All of that paid off, and money from freelancing soon just became extra income. I stopped seeking new freelance work after a few months.\",\n",
       " 'At this point, I was working entirely out of my home, so I had no commute. All I needed to create my software and market it was a computer and an Internet connection. I was creating all of this on my own, so I had no dependencies � nobody could stop me from delivering my product. My products were intentionally of a scope such that I could build them myself, but still be large and complex enough that they would be difficult for a competitor to replicate.',\n",
       " \"Growing my business occasionally required skills or time that I didn't have. But instead of hiring employees I wasn't sure I could afford in the long run, I contracted out specific tasks to other freelance software developers and artists that worked out of their own offices using their own equipment. Since these freelancers were experienced enough to work independently given spec�d out work, I was able to hire them from across the globe and without face to face interaction. This way, I preserved my freedom to work where I want.\",\n",
       " \"Since I was selling my product over the Internet, I soon found myself with customers all over the world, from every time zone. There was no expectation to meet with me face to face, because they knew I lived far away. Had I restricted myself to selling in my immediate area, my business would not have lasted a month. E-mail communication with my customers became the norm, and as long as they received a response within a day, they felt I was being responsive. So, I could choose whatever part of the day I wanted to communicate with my customers, preserving my freedom to work when I want. In fact, I've found it's much more efficient to let these messages pile up for a day and deal with them all at once, rather than waiting around all day for new messages to come in that you must respond to.\",\n",
       " \"At no point did I take on outside investment, a partner, or a board of advisors with a stake in the company. So, I had the freedom to work how I want. As someone who is newly self-employed, you will need advice from others, but I found this through my local business incubator and by interviewing CEO's of other, similar small companies that did not compete directly with my own. This gave me lots of free, but non-binding, advice to work with.\",\n",

       " \"You don't have to be a software developer to maximize the benefits of self-employment. Here are some other ideas of businesses that scale well without needing to hire a large full-time staff:\",\n",
       " \"Selling stuff on the Internet. It's still possible to earn a decent living selling unique goods on sites like Amazon, EBay, and Etsy. The trick is finding a niche that isn't currently well-served. What weird things are you passionate about? Is it just weird enough that there aren't many people producing merchandise for that interest, but not so weird that there is no real market for it? The other trick is selling something unique � if you're selling some commodity like electronics that any other retailer can offer, probably at a lower price, people will have no reason to buy from you.  Do your research � search for existing offerings and understand your competition before diving in. Also research the size of the market; get a Google AdWords account, and that will let you look up the popularity of specific search terms, which is a decent metric of what interests are more popular than others. Through the magic of drop-shipping, you may be even be able to separate yourself from the work of producing and distributing your product. This is also something you can try out on the weekends, before quitting your day job.\",\n",
       " \"Build an Online Marketplace for Services. Although I generally recommend selling products instead of services, in this case, services are the product. You're not directly responsible for the services provided; you just connect contractors and freelancers with clients for a fee. Angie's List is one extreme of this idea, but you could imagine building similar marketplaces for niche industries. Finding reliable software engineer freelancers, for example, is still a challenge. Again, this is an idea you can start up with minimal cash and time up front, and see if it grows before quitting the day job.\",\n",
       " \"Write Books. I'm trying this one out right now, myself! I saw that there were surprisingly few books on the topic of self-employment and lifestyle businesses, and writing one isn't that much work � so why not try it? Once it's written, it can generate revenue for years. If you have an area of expertise that's in demand, but niche enough that there aren't a lot of traditional educational options on it � odds are other people want to learn about it, and might stumble across your book in the process. Now that self-publishing and digital distribution of books is actually a viable business model, a book sold for a few dollars can still reach a large number of readers and generate decent income. As with everything, it's about finding an underserved niche � I hope the world needs this book, but it probably doesn't need another vampire romance novel.\",\n",
       " 'Develop Online Courses. As college tuition becomes increasingly expensive, more people are turning to online courses such as those offered through Coursera, Udemy, and General Assembly. These companies rely on instructors to create these courses, and in some cases share the profits with them. If you have a niche skill that�s in demand, creating some instructional videos on these platforms will generate ongoing revenue streams. Some people make entire businesses out of instructional content creation.',\n",
       " \"Build a website that helps people find hard-to-find stuff. For years, I've been scouring art fairs trying to find a painting that will actually look good on my wall at a reasonable price. That wall is still empty. That's just one example of a market where people have money to spend, but a hard time actually spending it. There are so many artisans out there in the world that it can be hard to find something that fits your own tastes and needs among all the other stuff that's available. Solving that problem in a creative way could be valuable, and perhaps extensible to areas other than art.\",\n",
       " 'None of these ideas are guaranteed to be successful, but they are all things you can potentially prototype just with your own spare time, throw them out there, and see if they have legs. Other ways to get your creative juices flowing would be to watch \"Shark Tank\" or similar shows where investors evaluate small businesses on TV, subscribe to a feed from TechCrunch to see what ideas are coming out of Silicon Valley, and most importantly � find enough time to actually be able to think creatively. If you\\'re running yourself ragged from your day job\\'s day to day responsibilities, you\\'ll be hard pressed to find the mental energy to conjure up original ideas. Instead of leaning in to your career, perhaps you\\'re better off leaning out a bit.',\n",
       " \"Also, stay vigilant for unsolved problems you encounter in your day to day life. Have you ever searched for a certain kind of product only to find it is unavailable or hard to find? Did you do anything today that forced you to waste time you'd rather have back? These may represent opportunities to fill an underserved need with your own business.

       " \"If you've got an idea of what you'd like to do while self-employed, here are a few good questions to ask yourself.\",\n",
       " 'Can I test this idea before I quit my day job? This question is important for two reasons: one, it evaluates if you can eliminate the risk involved in trying out your idea � worst case, you still have your day job. Two, it validates this is something you can accomplish yourself or with minimal freelance help. That makes it much easier to self-fund, it keeps your ongoing expenses low, and it frees you from the responsibilities that come with hiring people. Remember to check your employment agreement, and ensure working on this business won�t violate the terms of your employment or compete with your current employer.',\n",
       " 'Does this idea scale well? A digital product, or a product that can be manufactured by others, will free up your time after the initial product creation. Once your product is developed, you can focus on things like PR, marketing, and developing new products to grow your business further. You can sell as many of them as you wish. In contrast, a product you must personally create by hand for each customer is limited by the amount of time you have to create it. Even worse, selling your time as a service billed hourly can never scale beyond the number of productive hours you have in a week. Products and information may be replicated without limit, but your time is fixed in quantity.',\n",
       " 'Have I found an underserved niche? Sundog Software started with the observation that realistic 3D clouds were very hard to produce in flight simulators and games. Yet, this niche was not so small that there was no business to be had � big companies with very deep pockets are behind many simulators and games. Ask yourself what solutions already exist for the problem your business will solve, and whether you can do it better or at lower cost. If the answer is yes, do some research on your market to make sure there is enough demand for your product to end up paying your bills.',\n",
       " \"Estimating market sizes is probably worthy of another book of its own. Websites such as Alexa, or the keyword tool in Google AdWords, can be useful for measuring trends and overall interest for a given topic. Some key advice is to always estimate a market size from the bottom-up, instead of from the top-down. For example, don't estimate the size of your market by saying X% of the 7 billion people on the planet might be interested in it � that will almost always grossly overestimate it. Instead, start with a more realistic estimate of the number of customers in your local area or in similar niches, and work your way up. You want to find how many people will actually shell out their hard-earned cash for your product, not how many are just potentially interested in it.\",\n",
       " 'You also need to understand any existing competitors in your niche. How will your company differentiate itself? How much of your sales do you expect competitors to consume initially, and in the long term? The market you have found may not be entirely yours, and you need to factor that into your revenue projections.',\n",
       " 'Market research is a field unto itself, but you don�t have to make a science out of it. Use whatever data you can find to estimate the number of potential customers for your product, and use the Internet to discover competitors and how they seem to be doing. In the end, estimating your market size is an educated guess. You just want to educate yourself with any relevant data and competitive intelligence you can find.',\n",
       " \"Do my customers have money? I made this mistake myself once. My business started off selling primarily to big defense contractors and aerospace companies with big budgets, but my products were also relevant to video game developers. My market research showed there were over a million people across the world that call themselves game developers � so marketing to them seemed like a sure path to riches. What I didn't take into consideration is that the vast majority of game developers are kids living at home, using free tools to create games that will never see the light of day. Even the ones that are doing it professionally are usually working with little to no budget. I found plenty of customers in game development � but very little revenue. Make sure your potential customers not only have an interest in your product, but also the budgets or disposable income required to purchase it at the price you need to make a profit.\",\n",
       " 'Can I sell this globally? Can you accept orders over the Internet, and deliver your product or services wherever it is needed? If so, you are maximizing the size of your market, and also insulating yourself from economic or political crises that may be specific to one country. As an example, the US restricted its defense spending in recent years. If my only customers were in the US training and simulation industry, my business would be stagnant � but now, most of my customers are in Canada, Europe or Asia instead, and business continues to grow.',\n",
       " \"If you are selling globally, then you are also competing globally. Understanding your competition on a global scale then becomes especially important. Is someone in a country with a lower cost of living already offering what you do just as well, but at a much lower cost? If so, that's a problem.\",\n",
       " \"Can I automate sales and marketing? If you are selling your products globally over the Internet, traditional sales techniques such as cold-calling and doing in-person demos simply cannot scale. Hiring a salesperson probably won't help you, since that person can't be everywhere at once.\",\n",
       " 'Can you find new customers through what they are searching for on Google, or what demographics and interests they state they have on Facebook? Are there specific websites or publications that your customers tend to visit that you could advertise on? Can you direct these people to a web page designed to get them to try out your product, right then and there, free of obligation and with little expense to you?',\n",
       " \"If you can answer yes to those questions, then you may be able to automate much of your sales and marketing. Since we're trying to maximize the value you get out of your business with limited human resources, it's important to build systems that can allow a customer to discover, evaluate, and buy your product without involving you personally.\",\n",
       " \"Is this business hard to replicate? With seven billion people in the world and more getting born every minute, it's hard to find a unique idea. When you do, it probably won't stay unique for long � and the niche you are serving can only support so many of you. If you're selling a physical product, see if it's something you can at least apply for a provisional patent for. This is basically a way to protect your idea at a low cost for a period of time, while you build up enough profit to pay for a real patent application (that will run you about $10,000 by the way). Your patent is only as good as your ability to defend it, but having one will make it easier to sell your business in the future. I am not a lawyer, so you'll need to talk to yours for details.\",\n",
       " \"If your business is not something that lends itself to patent or copyright protection, you at least need to make sure what you are doing is unlikely to be replicated. Sometimes this means you are leveraging your own unique skills, interests, and talents to do something that is insurmountably hard for most others. Even a patent or copyright is no guarantee your work won't be stolen � what can you really do if someone on the other side of the planet takes your work and starts selling it as their own? Be sure to take steps to make that as difficult to do as possible, because it will happen. It happened to me. As much as people hate digital rights management, it is something you must think about if you plan to make a living selling digital products. Don�t buy into the idea that pirates wouldn�t have paid for your digital goods anyhow � once one of my own products for amateur game developers showed up on a popular pirate site, its sales went almost to zero.\",\n",
       " \"Is a large company likely to decide they want your market, throw more resources at it than you will ever have, and offer a competing product for free just to gain the market? That's a really fast way to go out of business; the most you can hope for is that they'll want to acquire you first, or hire you after they've ruined you. Your only real protection against this, apart from patent protection, is to serve a niche that large companies are unlikely to find interesting enough to go after. I'm quite happy with a few hundred thousand dollars per year coming out of my little niche, but that's chump change to a large company and not even worth talking about.\",\n",

I was cheap and set up a Limited Liability Company myself with the state, and got my own licenses from the county and city. It's actually not hard to set this up on your own, but it's easy to make the wrong choices. An LLC may offer no real protection to you, yet cost significantly more to set up than a sole proprietorship. Splitting the company 50/50 with your spouse may seem like a good idea, but it can cause big problems if you need to sell your company later. It is worth a few hundred dollars to involve a professional to determine the best corporate structure for your new business, even if it is only you. Otherwise you'll just end up paying to clean up your mess later on, like I did.\",\n",

Usually state licenses can be obtained over the web, and the local licenses may involve a phone call to city hall. Certain trades, such as electricians, require additional licenses as well. If you�re using a lawyer, they�ll know what to do � and they should be able to give you an estimate of the total costs, including for their time, as part of a free initial consultation.',\n",
       " 'If you have chosen to set up your US company as some sort of corporation for tax purposes, you will also need to apply for a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) at this point. This is basically a social security number for a business. Your lawyer or accountant can help with this, or you can apply online at irs.gov.',\n",
       " \"Once you have your necessary business licenses, you can go open a checking account for your business. Hopefully, your business will make money � and you'll need a place to put it! It will be important to keep your business income and expenses separate from your personal income and expenses for tax purposes, and also if you end up selling your business at some point. That bank account is a must.\",\n",
       " \"At this point, it's time to find an accountant. If your business involves technology or any sort of research and development, I recommend finding one who is familiar with the R&D tax credit laws if you're in the US. Your lawyer helped you to structure your company from a business standpoint, but you might structure your business differently from a tax standpoint � and that's where your accountant's advice comes in. \",\n",
       " 'It is also crucial to understand your new tax responsibilities as a self-employed individual. Even while you still have your day job, any money your side business earns is still self-employment income, and it is taxable. You may need to pay self-employment tax on it, and you will almost certainly need to pay estimated taxes each quarter based on it. Depending on the tax structure your accountant recommends, you might even be paying payroll taxes or giving yourself a paycheck and W2 forms.',\n",
       " 'Just make sure your initial conversation with your accountant stresses how much income you realistically expect to earn from your side business over the coming year, relative to your paycheck income � that can make a big difference on the strategy you initially take.  Your accountant doesn�t have time to look at your business plan, but come prepared with your realistic estimate of your net profit in the first tax year. If you plan on hiring or contracting anyone to help out with the ongoing development of your business, be sure your accountant knows about that as well. You will have reporting requirements to the IRS about money you spend on contractors that you need to understand, and there are rules about who can be considered a contractor and who is an employee.',\n",
       " \"Finally, you need to be tracking all of your expenses and income related to your business somehow � almost anything you spend on your side business is going to be tax-deductible. That includes deductions for space in your home used exclusively as a home office, business-related travel expenses (including trips in your own car,) a portion of any utility bills or house repairs for your house that contains your home office, and more. Talk to your accountant about what receipts you should be keeping, and how to keep track of your expenses going forward. I use Quickbooks Online to keep track of my bookkeeping. It's fairly easy to use, but if your accountant can help teach you how to use it properly, it's cheaper to do that now than to pay him to clean up your books at tax time later on. An accounting package such as Quickbooks is not only important for tax purposes, but also for measuring trends in your business and cash flow, issuing and tracking invoices, and other activities that are crucial to your business. You must take the time to become familiar with Quickbooks (or something like it, as long as it�s a package your accountant is also familiar with) before you spend or earn a penny on your business.\",\n",
       " 'LAUNCHING YOUR PRODUCT, AND MEASURING THE RESULTS',\n",
       " \"Building a great product in your spare time isn't enough � it�s worthless until you've gotten it into peoples' hands! You want some validation that your product can in fact generate enough revenue to live on, before you turn in your notice. That means you need to launch your product in some form while you're still employed, and measure the results.\",\n",
       " 'A launch limited to a small market is probably best; you don\\'t have the time to devote to a big splash, and you can apply what you\\'ve learned from your \"soft launch\" before you decide to go big with your product.',\n",
       " 'Can you identify a subset of the market for your product � one where you know what percentage of the total market they represent? Perhaps a limited geographic area or customers that visit a single website or mailing list you plan to announce your product on? The idea is to measure the response from this test market, and then extrapolate those results to a larger market.',\n",
       " \"Before launching, understand how you will measure the success of your launch, and define what you consider success to be. It's very tempting to start spinning your metrics in a positive light after you've launched your product, so define ahead of time what you'll measure and where that measurement needs to be before you'll turn in your notice.\",\n",
       " \"I'll make this easy for you � the only measurement that matters is how much money your product is making. How many people visited your website does not matter � at this stage, most of them are probably bots or people clicking on your ads by mistake anyhow. It's good to understand trends on your website through Google Analytics or similar tools, but these website metrics can be very distracting and misleading if you don't understand them deeply enough. How many people use a free version of your product also does not matter. These metrics maybe mean something in your day job at a larger company, but when it's your livelihood on the line, all that matters is the profit you make. I said profit, not revenue. If you earn $10,000 from your initial launch, but it cost $11,000 to manufacture the products you sold � you lose. (A nuance here is the concept of fixed versus variable costs � what you care about is how much money your business can generate on its own in the long run. Costs you sunk into product development are a one-time, variable expense, and so you wouldn't count those against your revenue when calculating profit for these purposes. Ongoing, fixed expenses such as the cost of producing your goods, or the cost of advertising and web hosting needed to produce those sales, would count.)\",\n",
       " 'If that previous paragraph confused you, you might consider taking a course from your local community college or an online course on the basics of accounting. It can be helpful when trying to understand if your business is sustainable or not, and it helps you to talk the same language with your accountant.',\n",
       " \"Let's say you plan on launching your product to a test market that represents 10% of your total market, and you need to earn $10,000 per month (pre-tax) to maintain your standard of living. Your goal then is to earn at least $1,000 in net profit during the first month. If you don't, then you're not ready to quit your job yet. It doesn't necessarily mean you give up � but you may need to spend more time refining your product offering in order to grow your profit to the point it needs to be. If you're a little short, that might be OK � you are only giving this business a part-time effort at this point, and it's pretty safe to say that it will be more successful once you dedicate your full-time attention to It.\",\n",
       " \"Understanding your success metrics is only one part of your launch plan. How will you announce your product launch? You can't just build it, and hope they'll come. Putting up a website about your product will accomplish nothing, unless you have a plan for driving traffic to it. Will you post on forums and mailing lists (in a tactful way that doesn't sound sales-ey?) Will you publish to social networks, LinkedIn groups, and the like? Will you issue a press release � and if so, which editors will you send it to? Will you pay for some online targeted advertising to drive some initial traffic to your product's website? If so, how much, and with whom? How will you optimize your site for search engine placement?\",\n",
       " 'What will you do post-launch? How will you handle customer support? If you anticipate a lot of it, it might be a good idea to take a week of vacation time from your day job during your initial launch until you can get a handle on it.',\n",
       " \"Don't give up too easily. Odds are you'll learn that your product requires more refinement once you start getting feedback from real customers. If it's something that's hurting sales, go ahead and iterate on your product offering and see if it translates into better sales. Your initial customers might even have ideas on new markets you can sell your product into. Even if the revenue stream you initially create isn't enough to quit your day job � it�s still extra revenue! As long as you feel the return you're getting is worth the time you're putting into it, continuing your side business without quitting your job is still an option. And, you may find that it organically grows over time to a business that does let you quit your day job in the future.\",\n",
       " \"Bear in mind too that whatever publicity you created for your initial result will probably result in an initial burst of sales that quickly dies down. This is normal, so don't measure your results over too long of a period at first. If you do decide to double-down on this new business, then you'll be creating an ongoing marketing strategy to keep your level of sales more steady.\",\n",
       " 'Also think about the sales cycle of your product. A big-ticket item may take months to sell, while prospective customers evaluate it and obtain the necessary budget to purchase it. Such items will require more time to measure success.',\n",
       " 'A very good sign is if your customers start recommending your product to others, leading to sales growth even after your initial launch push. As scary as it may be, monitor Internet forums where you have announced your product, and look for feedback. Search the web for mentions of your new product and see if it�s being recommended. If you are selling your product through an online storefront, how are the reviews? These are all ways that word of mouth works on the Internet, and it�s a very important growth channel that you must monitor and address. Services such as Google Alerts can help keep you informed of how your product is being received online.',\n",
       " \"Keep in mind that any creative endeavor you release publicly will be met with some degree of hate online, no matter how good it is. There are a lot of kids on the Internet who have nothing better to do than try to make as many people feel bad about themselves as possible, and who will post harsh criticism of anything they encounter, regardless of its merit.  Their comments are rarely constructive. The best thing you can do is ignore them, although that's very hard to do at first. You must resist the temptation to give them the attention they're seeking by reacting to their inflammatory comments. If your product does have merit, you'll often find that others come to your defense on your behalf. Just be thankful that your product launch was big enough to get noticed by Internet trolls! That in itself is an accomplishment. In the end, it's not online comments that matter; it's the people who vote with their wallets by purchasing your product. If comments are overwhelmingly negative, that will affect your sales � but if nobody's coming to your defense against the trolls, perhaps your product does in fact require refinement. That's why we launched to a test market � so the damage from an inadequate product offering would be constrained, and you can still try again.\",\n",
       " 'Finally, remember you\\'re still keeping your business quiet among your peers at this stage. When publicizing your initial launch, don\\'t release anything publicly that ties you personally to the business, or can be used to personally identify you or where you live. Even after you quit your day job and \"come out,\" this sort of information should be kept private. Those Internet trolls I mentioned have been known to do things as silly as placing pizza delivery orders to the home addresses of their targets, or as scary as sending SWAT teams to your house for an alleged hostage situation.

There's a lot that can still go wrong, and you need to have a backup plan in place. Maybe you have a higher risk tolerance than I do, but remember in the US you have no safety net as an entrepreneur. If your business goes bust, you cannot collect unemployment benefits12 � you�re entirely on your own. Having a backup plan in place really is crucial.\",\n",

We also talked about properly factoring in a higher cost of health insurance into that number, and having reserves to cover what may be a higher health insurance deductible once you're on your own. Health care is not the only cost you will incur. There are some other expenses you'll need to consider when you're self-employed, and you need to make sure you have a plan for them as well. For items that apply to you, go back and update your business plan to account for these new expenses, and make sure you�re still financially comfortable with taking the leap into full-time self-employment. Once you have an idea of what your new business will be, you should be able to estimate these extra costs.\",\n",

When talking to your accountant, make sure you understand how much this will end up being. In many cases, the additional tax deductions you can take as a business owner will help to offset this, and there are tax strategies (such as filing both as an S-corp and as an individual) that can help to minimize this expense. But your accountant will need to analyze your individual situation.\",\n",
       " \"Life and disability insurance. If your employer offered subsidized life or disability insurance and you want to continue that coverage, you'll need to find your own plan and pay its premiums on your own.

It\\'s bad enough that you\\'re probably going to end up paying a ridiculously high health insurance premium once you\\'re on your own, but it\\'s even worse to know it probably won\\'t cover much of anything.

Is anyone in your family on any prescription medication? Are periodic doctor visits needed to maintain those prescriptions?

Had I waited until after quitting, that may have been impossible. Working out a relocation at the same time as this career change can be tricky, but it can be done. Taking on new debt at a time like this may sound crazy, but as long as you\\'re disposing of higher levels of monthly payments at the same time (by selling your old house and car), it\\'s a win.

For a low monthly cost, I've received free consultations with web designers, accountants, lawyers, government contracting officials, and an entire course on entrepreneurship � along with an office and meeting space when I need it. It's pretty common for people to enter this program before they have quit their day job, and get some extra education on successful entrepreneurship before taking the plunge. If your locale has similar resources, I encourage you to explore them. They can even connect you with local angel investors.

Everyone's path is a little different, and what worked for someone else's business might not be relevant to yours. For example, in the early days of my business, I received a lot of advice about sales techniques � but these were from people doing business only in our local area. My global, Internet-based business did not benefit from these techniques, and ultimately it proved to just be a distraction.

There should be no shortage of people willing to help you for free. If you really, really want to give up some ownership of your company for some bizarre reason, make sure any agreement is drafted by your own lawyer and is explicit about what they are expected to do in order to retain that ownership stake. Your lawyer will hopefully talk some sense into you at this point, anyhow.

You can target your display ads to specific websites, or let Google try to automatically find relevant websites for you.',\n",

AdWords will provide you with stunning amount of graphs and statistics surrounding the performance of your advertising campaigns� but there is only one number that really matters: your cost per action (CPA).  This is how much, on average, you paid to create a new customer through your ads. In order to measure CPA, you will need to find some action that users take on your website that indicates they have become a customer, and feed those actions back to Google. Usually this means they purchased something from you online. If you are using a third-party storefront to sell your products, ask them how they are integrated with Google AdWords or with Google Analytics and how to tie into your AdWords account. If customers perform this action on your own website, AdWords will tell you how to insert some extra code in your website that notifies Google when this action occurs.',\n",
       " 'CPA is usually referred to as \"cost per converted click\" within AdWords, and you may need to add a column for this metric to your views within AdWords to see it and track it.',\n",
       " 'You can set up AdWords campaigns that automatically optimize for the best CPA, but for this to work well, you need a good amount of \"action\" data. If your business relies on a small number of high-dollar sales, sales might not be the best action to measure. In this case, you may need to use some proxy for sales, such as downloading an evaluation of your product, in order to generate sufficient data for Google to work with.',\n",
       " \"If the action you want of your visitors doesn't take place online at all, you have a bit of a problem. Perhaps you are running a retail storefront, and what you're trying to do is get people to visit your physical store. First of all, consider if there's an opportunity to also sell your goods online, where you can measure the effectiveness of your advertising. If not, you can at least restrict your online advertising geographically to people who are near your physical storefront. A geographically restricted, targeted ad campaign will be inexpensive, so even if you can't measure its results directly, it's probably still worth doing.\",\n",
       " \"You need to decide how much you're willing to spend on whatever action you choose to measure. You don't want to spend $10 in exchange for a customer who only gives you $5 in profit. Even breaking even isn't enough� some of the customers that came to your website through ad campaigns may have found you anyhow through other means.  If your CPA isn't significantly less than the value of the action you are measuring, then your ad campaign is not effective and needs further tuning.\",\n",
       " \"Tread carefully with mobile ads. By default, your ads will appear on desktop PC's, tablets, and mobile devices. If your desired action requires that the user is on a PC, then you're largely throwing your money away on tablet and mobile ads. Google does give you the ability to modify the devices your ads are shown on, so use that wisely. \",\n",
       " \"Also realize that the smaller the screen, the more likely someone is to tap your ad by mistake. Google will charge you by the click, even if you're optimizing for actions� so if people are tapping your ad that had no interest in your product, you are going to be driving up your CPA for no reason.\",\n",
       " 'What\\'s even worse are ads embedded inside mobile apps. App developers often make all of their money through these ads, and sometimes design their apps to trick users into clicking on them. Google does not make it easy to disable these sorts of ads, but it can be done. You\\'ll have to search for the current technique, as it is likely to change over time. At the time of this writing, you can exclude mobile app ads by setting up a \"campaign placement exclusion\" for adsenseformobileapps.com.',\n",
       " \"Separate your search and display campaigns. It's a good practice to set up separate ad campaigns in AdWords for your ads that appear alongside search results, and for your banner ads that appear on websites that participate in Google's advertiser network. That way, Google can optimize these very different campaigns separately.\",\n",
       " \"Don't display your ads in countries that won't buy your product. Your campaign settings allow you to list specific countries your ad will appear in, as well as specific countries you don't want your campaign to appear in. To minimize the risk of click fraud� companies that just click on ads on websites automatically in order to generate revenue for those sites� don't display your ads in countries that are unlikely to want your product. I don't want to name names, but some countries are more notorious than others when it comes to click fraud. At a minimum, you'll want to ban countries that are embargoed that you can't do business with in the first place. You can get a list of embargoed countries from the US Department of State's website. Countries where the English language isn't commonly known may also be worth avoiding, if your website is in English. You may be surprised how many foreigners do know English as a second language however; some of the top countries that visit my website include Russia, China, and Germany, and they spend real money once they get there.\",\n",
       " \"Tread carefully with the display ad network. If you are targeting a narrow niche of customers, it will be difficult for Google to automatically find the best websites to show your ads on. Instead of letting Google pick what sites to display your banner ads on, choose your own list and specify them as placements in your ad groups. Using the display ad network also increases your chance of being a victim of click fraud� I've found it often drives up traffic to my website significantly, but it doesn't increase business because most of the clicks were fraudulent or done by mistake. Search ads, and display ads that target specific people instead of certain kinds of websites, are more effective.\",\n",
       " 'Use negative keywords. In your search campaigns, periodically check what people are actually searching for before they click on your ads.

New trends can even emerge that affect you� for example, one of my own products is called \"SilverLining\". When the movie \"Silver Lining Playbook\" came out, I ended up paying hundreds of dollars from people searching for it.',\n",
       " 'Avoid \"broad match\" keywords. By default, the search keywords you target in your search campaign are \"broad match.\" This means that any search term that Google\\'s algorithms believe are even remotely related will be shown your ad. Sometimes it gets it right, but as reviewing your search terms will reveal, it often gets it very wrong. It is better to provide a longer list of very specific phrases that are relevant to your business, with exact or phrase matching on instead. Often, you\\'ll find this saves money in more ways than one� not only are you only showing your ads alongside relevant searches, these more specific keywords probably cost less to bid on, as there is less competition for them.',\n",
       " 'Use ad extensions on your search campaigns. Ad extensions are additional links that show up underneath your search ads. They can include links to specific pages of your website, \"call-outs\" that are short snippets of text that toot your own horn, and links that make it easy for customers to reach your physical location or to call you. They don\\'t cost anything extra, and they can result in more screen space being dedicated to your search ads. You can set these up under the \"ad extensions\" tab of your campaign view.',\n",
       " \"Try out remarketing campaigns. AdWords can give you some code to include in your website that will track customers that have visited it. You can then show display ads to them as they browse the web on other sites. A lot of people will visit your website, but not act upon it immediately. Remarketing campaigns allow you to remind them that you're around, and you have something they were interested in. This can be surprisingly effective; it's basically an automatic way to close sales without involving salespeople. Some of my best CPA's are from remarketing campaigns.\",\n",
       " 'Use \"similar visitors\". Once you have a remarketing campaign set up, you can also start showing ads to people who have similar behavior to the people who visited your website. To do this, you set up a campaign targeted to an \"audience\" that is composed to similar visitors to your website. I\\'ve found these campaigns yield CPA\\'s that are even lower than remarketing at times.',\n",

Once you\\'ve gotten things up and running and have started collecting some data, you\\'ll probably get a call or an email from a Google \"account strategist\" who wants to set up some time to review your account. This time can be amazingly well spent. I\\'ve found these representatives to be very knowledgeable about optimizing the results you get from your AdWords campaigns, and they often have ideas I never considered. They also take the time to try and understand your business and what you\\'re trying to accomplish before they even talk to you. Nobody knows more about optimizing AdWords campaign than Google itself, so definitely accept their help when they offer it to you.',\n",
       " 'Use landing page optimization techniques. We\\'ll talk about this more later, but the page you link an ad to (the \"landing page\") should be closely tied to the ad itself, and what the user searched for in order to see your ad. Some sites create individual pages for every ad they run, in order to ensure the page the user ends up at is as relevant as possible to their current interest and the ad they clicked on. For this to work best, you\\'ll want to split up your AdWords campaigns into separate ad groups targeted at specific customer personas, and tailor the keywords, ads, and landing pages to be unique for each ad group. AdWords is also more likely to display ads that link to pages that are highly relevant to the ad itself, and so this effort pays off in more ways than one.',\n",
       " 'Buying Banner Ads',\n",
       " 'If there are websites that are strongly related to what your business offers, you might consider purchasing ads on those sites directly. These direct ad buys are often much more expensive than what you would pay through Google AdWords or other ad networks. Sometimes, these web sites will sell ads directly, and sell any unused page views (\"impressions\") through Google\\'s AdSense network. These left-over ad impressions are known as \"remnant ads,\" and they can offer an opportunity to test the waters on a website without spending a lot of money. Check if your website is one you can target as a placement in your AdWords account, and if so, you can probably get some ads on it at a very low cost.',\n",
       " \"Those remnant ads tend to be for lower-value placements on the site however, so you can't necessarily use their performance as a gauge for how well a better-placed banner ad at the top of their site would do.\",\n",
       " 'How can you decide if a paid ad placement on a specific website is worthwhile? Well, a decent assumption is that perhaps 1% of people who see your ad on a relevant website will click on it. You can use metrics from your website to estimate what percentage of visitors to your website end up buying something, and use that information to estimate the amount of sales this ad might generate. If it�s substantially more than the expense of a given number of ad impressions, then this could be money well spent.',\n",
       " 'Oftentimes, the math won\\'t support the ad buy. The person selling you this ad will probably talk a lot about \"brand awareness\" and other intangible benefits of the ad, but you will never have any way of measuring whether it\\'s effective. Just let them know what price does make sense for you� if they aren\\'t selling through their available ad impressions, they may give you a bargain or some sort of attractive bundle deal.',\n",
       " 'If you do purchase a banner ad directly from a website owner, be sure that the URL you link the ad to contains any tracking codes required for you to measure how many visitors this ad generated, and how they behaved once they got to your website. We\\'ll talk more about Google Analytics and measuring website performance later, but if you do use Google Analytics, it offers a \"URL Builder\" tool that can construct the required URL\\'s for you. You\\'ll want to review the performance of this ad at least once a month, as you\\'ll probably find that its performance deteriorates over time as people become accustomed to your ad. When that happens, you may want to try replacing the banner ad with a fresh one in order to catch more attention.',\n",
       " 'Since you\\'re paying a lot for this ad, try to make it as relevant as possible to the readers of the site you\\'re advertising on. Make it look like it\\'s content that could even be part of the site, and not just an ad that people tune out. Some websites will offer \"advertorial\" features or �native ads� that integrate into the design of the site itself, and these are often more effective than traditional banner ads � but also more expensive.',\n",
       " \"Also, be sure to use a trained graphic designer to create your banner ads. There is a whole science to creating ads with just the right colors, contrast, and style to maximize their performance. It's money well spent. Arm your designer with some images and a very short amount of text you want included in the ad, and let them come up with ideas. You can also re-use these ads in your AdWords account, and run different variants of them at the same time to measure which ones are the most effective.\",\n",
       " 'Facebook Ads',\n",
       " 'If your business caters to a specific demographic that you can identify through gender, location, occupation, or interests� Facebook ads may be worth trying out.',\n",
       " \"Facebook users entrust Facebook with a ridiculous amount of their personal information, and you can use this to your advantage. Facebook allows you to target ads to extremely narrow demographic slices. If these slices correlate to your customers, and your customers are likely to use Facebook, then it's worth trying out. Like AdWords, you can spend as little or as much as you want� so you can test the waters with Facebook ads without incurring a large expense.\",\n",
       " \"I have personally found it challenging to achieve a cost per action with Facebook ads that outperforms a well-optimized AdWords campaign, but results will vary widely depending on the nature of your business. It's worth spending $100 as a test and just see what sort of return you get on that. Facebook also offers a robust system for measuring the performance of your ads, and so you can just decide whether to use them based on the data.\",\n",
       " 'Be sure you are looking at actual traffic generated to your website by these ads, however. Remember someone \"liking\" you on Facebook is pretty much worthless. Facebook will try and group clicks, likes, and shares together when presenting the value of your ad. Likes and shares don\\'t pay the bills� people who click on your website and buy something do.',\n",
       " 'As with display ads on Google AdWords, you need to be aware of click fraud with Facebook ads as well. There are \"click farms\" in places like the Philippines that have armies of people creating fake Facebook accounts that generate fake likes and shares for people. These can affect you, because to escape detection, they \"like\" other things they are presented (such as your ad) so it\\'s not so obvious what they are doing. The more sophisticated click farms even make it look like their clicks are originating from US cities, making them difficult to filter out. As a basic line of defense, at least set up some geographical targeting in your account to only show your ads to people in parts of the world that are likely to respond to them. There are stories of small businesses spending lots of money on Facebook ads, only to find out later that most of their response came from a click farm in Iraq. No joke. Facebook, like Google, is doing their best to eliminate fraud from their advertising programs, but it is a never-ending arms race with the fraudsters.',\n",
       " \"With any advertising, it's important to evaluate whether you saw an increase in sales associated with the campaign. No matter what metrics you may have about the reach of your ad, all that really matters is whether it generated more sales revenue than the cost of the campaign in the long run. Every market is different, so I recommend setting up relatively inexpensive tests with various advertising channels to see what works best.\",\n",

       " 'You should think about where your customers hang out online, as it could be one of those places. Ads on Amazon may make a lot of sense if you are selling a consumer-oriented product. Your customers may be highly active on Twitter or LinkedIn, and advertising there may be a good way to reach them without investing huge amounts of time managing your social media presence.',\n",
       " 'My general advice is to work backwards from where your customers are, and advertise there. Target your ads to your potential customers as well as you can. And test the waters with any new advertiser with a low-cost campaign before investing significant money with them. You can learn a lot by gambling just $100, or the lowest-cost ad campaign a channel offers, and comparing the resulting CPA�s after a week or two.',\n",

       " 'Not all advertising is online. As an example, let�s say your business sells some specialty item for amateur astronomers. In that case, taking out an ad in Sky & Telescope magazine might make perfect sense. If there is some publication that is highly relevant to what your business offers, it deserves your consideration.',\n",
       " \"You can still do some back-of-the-envelope calculations to figure out if it�s worthwhile. You can find out the number of copies of the magazine that are printed, and how many aren't returned unsold. That tells you how many people your ad will reach. Assume less than 1% will act on your ad, and some small percentage of those who do actually buy something in the end. If the sales number you end up with exceeds the cost of the ad, it may be worth trying. A small ad in the back of a niche publication can often be had for just a few hundred dollars, so it's not an expensive experiment to try.\",\n",
       " \"How do you know if a sale resulted from that ad, however? There are only two ways I know of. One is to simply ask your customers how they found you after you've taken their money� many will be happy to share that information. The other is to use some custom URL or phone number that is specific to this ad. Then, the number of visits to that URL or number of calls will tell you how many people acted on that ad, and who ended up buying something later on.\",\n",
       " 'As with everything, measure the results before investing more money into any advertising channel.',\n",
       " \"In addition to magazines� newspapers, local television, niche cable TV channels, and radio are other advertising venues worth thinking about. If you've followed my advice about building a business that has a global reach, local TV, radio, and news advertising probably isn't worthwhile� but for many businesses, it is. As with online advertising, the key is to find a way to target your message to the people most likely to respond to it. If there's a local TV show and you know most of its viewers are potential customers of yours, it's worth thinking about. Advertising on it won't be cheap, but it might be something you decide to save up for.\",\n",
       " \"There are other ways to advertise in the physical world, as well. Think creatively about places where your potential customers tend to congregate exclusively. Is there an industry trade show, conference, or convention they go to? Consider advertising in its program, or being a sponsor of it.  Are a lot of them in a specific office park? Consider a nearby billboard, or an ad on a bus stop bench. Is there a popular Meetup group for them? Consider hosting that group at your own venue, joining it, or sponsoring it. Selling your stuff at a Meetup gathering is poor form, but it's totally OK to tell people what you do while introducing yourself. People who might be interested will talk to you afterward.\",\n",
       " \"Trade show booths are another form of advertising, but in my experience their value proposition can be dodgy for small businesses like yours. You're looking at over $10,000 plus travel expenses for even the smallest booth in most cases, so you need to be pretty confident that your presence there will generate more than $10,000 in new profits. For a small business, that's a pretty tall order. And you can't just put up a booth in the corner and expect people to come dump money on your lap� you need to do a lot of work before the trade show to publicize your booth to attendees, and arrange meetings with potential customers at the show ahead of time. You'll need to invest a lot of time in following up with people afterwards, as well. Often it's more cost-effective to just attend the show as an individual, and carry around a bunch of business cards for the connections you make while you're there. I like to walk around with a tablet running a demo of my software, so I can show interested parties my technology without a booth at all (be careful not to run afoul of any policies of the trade show when doing something like that� your smartphone may have to do if attendees aren't permitted to bring larger items onto the show floor). You may get more value focusing your time on networking at the show, instead of manning a booth. Still, consider it carefully. In some industries (arcade games come to mind), a booth at a specific trade show is basically the only way in, so I can't provide one-size-fits-all advice on the topic.\",\n",
       " 'How about physical mailings? In the early stages of my company, I mined my LinkedIn network and LinkedIn groups to find people who might need my product, and were in a position to approve its purchase. I went to their company websites to get a mailing address, and sent each of them a physical brochure accompanied by a personalized, signed letter. About 10% of the people I contacted ended up purchasing my product� which is an excellent return on some paper, a stamp, and a few minutes of my time! I ended up contracting a college student to help scale that effort up.

The content you create for your blog can also be re-used for social media and email newsletters, discussed below.

As with everything, keep these emails customer-focused; they should address the problems your customers are faced with, and that might not even have anything to do with your products. The main point is to remind your subscribers that you're around, and that your company is an authority in solving whatever problems they have. Keep the tone conversational, so your customers feel like they're reading a personal email and not just product marketing.\",\n",
       " \"Email frequency is also something to think about. Once or twice a month is enough to keep your company in the back of everyone's minds.  Emails sent too frequently will start to be viewed as spam, and increase the likelihood of people unsubscribing.\",\n",
       " \"Finally� make sure to send a test mail to yourself before pushing the button to send it to your entire mailing list! You want to catch missing subject lines, broken links, and typos before your customers do. Once that mass email goes out, there's no way to take it back� so take your time editing and proofreading it first.\",\n",
       " 'USING SOCIAL NETWORKS',\n",
       " 'Marketing through social networks has become challenging, as they are starting to push paid advertising in favor of reach that could be had for free in years past. But in many industries, social networks are still an important component of your inbound marketing efforts. If your customers spend a lot of time on social networks, then figuring out how to reach them � and their friends � is worthwhile.',\n",
       " \"You need to think about who your customers are, and where they hang out online. Are you selling craft products? Pinterest may be the most important network for you to focus on, then. Marketing to younger people? Try Instagram. Business-to-business? LinkedIn might be for you (that�s the one I target the most). Twitter is still important as well. I'm sure that list will probably change by this time next year, so again� just think about what social networks are used most by your potential customers, and focus on them.\",\n",
       " 'Effective maintenance of a social network presence can be a full time job in itself. As a small business owner, you need to just pick one or two of them to focus on. Here are some general social media tips:',\n",
       " \"Twitter is a lot of work. Twitter posts in themselves are very likely to be lost in the noise of everything else. Using Twitter effectively is more about outreach through your other activities on Twitter. You should be retweeting and replying to people within your industry much more often than you are posting about your own company. Twitter is about building up your subscriber base, and staying active not only with your own announcements but in the discussions of others. Even if you have a product announcement that gets re-tweeted by some account with a huge amount of followers, you'll just see a surge of traffic that disappears within a few minutes. The goal here is to become a well-known name within the community of your potential customers� and that's better served by re-tweeting information that is useful to them, regardless of whether it comes from your company or not. You need to be posting several times per day to get the most out of Twitter from a marketing standpoint, so think carefully about whether you expect the return from that effort to be worth the time.\",\n",
       " 'With Facebook, my advice is almost to not even bother. Even if you can get a large number of people to \"like\" your company page, your updates will only be shown to about 6% of those followers� and that number is likely to decrease further as Facebook tries to force companies into paid advertising and promotion of their posts. As discussed earlier, Facebook is worth evaluating as an advertising platform, but don\\'t expect much free exposure for your company through it. There may be some SEO benefit to having a FaceBook page that links to your main website, and that alone may be worth the small effort of setting one up.',\n",
       " 'LinkedIn is useful for B2B businesses. If you\\'re a business that sells to other businesses, LinkedIn is worth looking at. Product announcements framed as a personal achievement aren\\'t viewed as \"spammy\" there, and getting involved in LinkedIn group discussions is an easy way to get your name in the inbox of hundreds of people. ',\n",
       " \"Don't just post about your company. Become a valued resource for the people who follow you. Don't just market your stuff� find articles and information that are relevant to your customer base. Participate in other discussions. Nobody wants to follow a commercial on social media (unless it�s incredibly clever); instead, provide useful content that's all about your customers, not all about you.\",\n",
       " \"Maintaining a social network presence for your company can be very time-consuming, and as a small business owner you probably have more efficient ways to spend your time. As addictive as social media can be, you must measure the impact it is having on your business, and budget your time accordingly. If your social media efforts aren't resulting in a substantial percentage of your website traffic originating from social media sites, or your customers aren't saying they discovered you through social media, then you should question if this is what you should be spending your time on.\",\n",

       " 'MEASURE AND ACT',\n",
       " \"It's important that you measure the effectiveness of your various marketing campaigns, and act upon those results.\",\n",
       " 'If you sell products online, Google Analytics is a free, sophisticated tool that lets you track trends with your customers, and where those customers came from. Go get an account, and integrate it with your website and any other websites that sell your products on your behalf.',\n",
       " \"I could write an entire book about using Google Analytics, and I'm sure others have. But even with the most basic integration, you'll be able to measure things like how many visitors came to your website each day, which websites they came to yours from, what countries they are in, and what devices they are using to view your site.\",\n",
       " 'Here are some of the more important metrics you�ll see within Google Analytics, and how you should act on them:',\n",
       " 'Sessions: This is how many times your site was visited each day. If you see a sudden surge or drop, it�s worth understanding why � dig into your �acquisition� metrics to narrow down which source of traffic changed. If it�s across the board, then this might indicate a technical problem with your website that needs fixing. However, you shouldn�t necessarily panic if this drops, or congratulate yourself if it increases. Sessions don�t pay the bills; it�s the quality of that traffic that matters.',\n",
       " 'Conversions: Once you�ve set up goals in Google Analytics tied to people actually giving you money, or doing something that is a good proxy for giving you money, this is the main thing you want to focus on. Google Analytics allows you to break down your conversion data by location and source, and to analyze the path users took before they completed your conversion actions. Trends that you see in your conversion data will affect your bottom line and your livelihood, so it is critical to monitor, understand, and act upon this data. If conversions for a specific product are dropping, you need to figure out how to boost its marketing, make the product more appealing, make its web page more likely to convert, and/or abandon it in favor of creating a better product.',\n",
       " 'Average Time on Page: This is a measure of user engagement with your site. If it�s dropping, then the traffic you are attracting to your website isn�t really interested in what you have to offer. Evaluate your marketing efforts, and whether they are really reaching the right people. A drop in this metric may also indicate a rise in malicious traffic to your site, which you may need to block.',\n",
       " 'Channels: This section, under �acquisition�, lets you break down your traffic by where it came from. You may see data for sessions that originated from direct traffic (someone typed your URL into the address bar,) organic (free) search, paid search, display ads, social media, or referrals from other sites. The balance between free and paid traffic is good to understand, as it lets you know how important those paid advertisements really are to your business. Ideally you�d want your traffic to grow over time, but come increasingly from free sources like good SEO and PR practices. This view also makes it easy to determine the return on investment on your paid advertising, which may influence your decisions on whether to spend more or less on it. Digging into the �referral� channel can also be interesting; as it lets you know what other websites are driving traffic to yours.  Often, you�ll discover online discussions about your product in this manner, and this is an opportunity to go chime in yourself as the owner of the company and keep the discussion going.',\n",
       " 'INTERPRETING YOUR METRICS',\n",
       " 'If you do one thing beyond the basic integration of Google Analytics, make it setting up \"goals\". This can currently be done from the Administration menu. You tag your site with certain events that tell Google Analytics when a customer does something valuable� like purchasing a product, downloading an evaluation or white paper, etc.  Armed with that information, you can not only see the effect your marketing efforts are having on traffic to your site, but the impact they are having on sales.',\n",
       " \"There is good website traffic, and there is bad traffic. Looking at visitors or page views alone can be very misleading. Perhaps you have an ad that is attention-grabbing, but reaching the wrong people� they come to your website, but never buy anything. Visitor data can also be polluted by malicious traffic, such as referrer spam13 or click fraud. Or maybe you have an ad on a display network that got picked up by some mobile app that tricks its customers into clicking on it, resulting in more junk traffic to your site. It's those goals, also referred to as conversions in Google Analytics, which you should be focusing on� not page views or visits.\",\n",
       " \"View your web metrics with skepticism. Many times I've been excited to see a surge in traffic to my website, only to find that it's all coming from a country that doesn�t even speak English and is likely part of some click fraud ring. Other times, it's a surge in referrer spam. Always dig into what drove a change in your metrics� view the traffic by country, and by referrer, to make sure it is legitimate.\",\n",
       " \"A drop in traffic or conversions however is worth digging into. It could be indicative of a technical problem with your website, a change to search engine algorithms that affected you, an important referrer dropped their link to your site, or it could just mean that you haven't spent enough time on marketing lately. Checking your Google Analytics metrics every day is sure to shake you into action when things are not heading in the right direction.\",\n",
       " \"Be sure to look at long term as well as short term trends. Don't just focus on data from the past week, as it will be easy to overlook a longer-term increase or decrease in your business. It's those long-term trends that are the hardest to turn around, so you need to be aware of them if they exist, understand what's driving them, and do something about them if your business is to survive. Perhaps your product is simply losing its relevance in the marketplace slowly over time, despite your best efforts to market it. Doubling down further on marketing is not the answer in that case� the answer is to start building a new product that addresses the new problems your customers need to solve.\",\n",
       " \"Tying your sales information to Google Analytics lets you make very precise statements about the return on investment for various marketing efforts. Armed with that data, you can do more of what's effective for your business, and less of what's not.\",\n",
       " \"Metrics for your website aren't the only metrics you should be following, of course. Use the reports in whatever accounting package you are using to ensure your cash flow is stable, your revenue is growing, and your expenses are under control. Keep an eye on your business bank account, and have a number in mind below which you start to get worried. It's easy to overspend on advertising, and it's easy for markets to change or for competitors to eat into your business� requiring you to build a new product before revenue from the old one completely dries up. Ultimately, your sales revenue trends are the best indicator of when that needs to be done.\",\n",
       " 'TRACKING AND CLOSING SALES',\n",
       " 'As a new business owner, you\\'ll probably hear about \"CRM\" solutions such as salesforce.com, Zoho, and many others. CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, and it�s really just a fancy term for a sales database.',\n",
       " \"It is important that you keep track of your sales somewhere. You want to be able to contact your past customers if you need to, or just to let them know about new products of interest to them. But, you may be able to get by with just a spreadsheet at first. There's no need to invest in an expensive CRM system until you've got a handle on how sales of your product are driven. These systems are geared toward full-time sales people who mine leads, make cold calls, and follow up with their prospects until they close a sale. If you've followed my advice however, your products sell themselves on the Internet through your automated targeted online ads. Investing lots of your time into each individual sale simply does not scale when you're a one person company, especially when your market is large and worldwide. Your sales process needs to be as automated as possible.\",\n",
       " \"Email campaigns can be used to close sales automatically. Most email platforms allow you to set up automatic rules to send a series of pre-written emails over time to new customers when they are added to your mailing list. For example, once a potential customer signs up for a trial of your product, you can automatically email that person a few days later to ask how it's going, and to offer some tips for getting the most out of the trial. Just prior to the end of the trial period, that customer can receive another automated email reminding them it's time to purchase it. Your customers are busy, and they need these reminders. A computer can send those reminders just as well as a human being can� once a human being has written the form-letter emails once. It's good to include contact information if they do want to talk to you, but most people just need a little nudge. That nudge can make a real difference in your sales. Automated systems like MailChimp can send as many of those nudges as you need, at very low cost and while you sleep.\",\n",

       " 'BEWARE OF LEECHES',\n",
       " 'Being a new business owner is intimidating. No matter how good you were in your corporate career, it left you largely unprepared for launching a business of your own. When people emerge who are willing to help you get started, it can seem like good fortune� but be wary. Very wary.',\n",

       " \"There are predators out there that look for new business owners, and try to scam them out of ownership of their business. If someone you only met recently wants to be your partner, be on your board of directors, or be your co-founder� don't do it. Once you've signed an agreement with this person that gives them some percentage of your company, you'll probably never hear from them again until it's time for them to collect their money.\",\n",
       " \"Even if you decide to share your company with someone who is generally well-meaning, taking on partners can still go very wrong. What happens if your partner gets a divorce? Could their share of the company end up getting transferred to their spouse, who will now be your new partner, like it or not? What happens if they die? What happens if they just lose interest in your company after a few months and stop contributing in a meaningful manner? It's possible to create a legal agreement that addresses these contingencies, but it's best to just avoid the situation entirely.\",\n",
       " \"Even sharing your company with your spouse can be a bad idea. Apart from the obvious problem of what happens if you get divorced for whatever reason, it can create problems if you end up selling your company later on. Whoever is interested in purchasing your company wants to deal with a single decision-maker, and if you've split ownership of your company 50/50 with your spouse, they now need to deal with both of you. Some acquirers would just walk away.\",\n",
       " 'It makes sense to seek outside expertise on areas that are crucial to your business, and complement your own knowledge with those of others. But that expertise usually can be had for free through your local business incubator, economic development council, or Meetup groups. Professional services can be purchased on an hourly basis. Giving up a percentage of a lifestyle business rarely makes sense, and it ties you down unnecessarily.',\n",

This book isn't about growth businesses. If you're unsure whether your company is a growth business or a lifestyle business, you must achieve clarity on your long-term plans for your company and your own life first.

Even if they are selling on the Internet, their customers may be very different from yours.\",\n",
       " 'Always consider advice through the lens of \"how similar is this person\\'s business to my own?\" It\\'s great to receive unsolicited advice, but it\\'s even better to seek out other small business owners yourself that do run businesses similar to your own. As long as you\\'re not competing with them, they\\'ll probably be happy to offer whatever advice you want over coffee or a phone call. I\\'ve said this before in this book, but it bears repeating.',\n",
       " \"Here's a real example. When I started my own business, I heard a lot about the importance of sales efforts. You know, gathering lists of prospects, making cold calls, doing in-house demos, and following up to close sales.  Through my local business incubator, I met lots of other business owners who testified to the importance of these techniques. Based on their advice, I was convinced that having a real sales team was crucial to my business's success.\",\n",
       " 'Trouble is, those other companies relied almost entirely on sales within their local area, and they were selling big-ticket products and services that cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Furthermore, their customers are in industries where they are accustomed to dealing with sales people all the time. In contrast, my own products are relatively inexpensive, and sold globally through the Internet. Most of my customers are software engineers, who hate nothing more than a sales person wasting their time.',\n",

He was happy to help� and I learned that he saw the most success through automated email campaigns.

These people are trained at mental manipulation, and they know how to sell themselves just as well as they can sell any product. If you've never done any sales work yourself, then you have no way to really evaluate them or know what questions to ask them. It's just too easy to get won over by a salesperson that will ultimately be ineffective, and waste a lot of your precious bootstrap money in the process.\",\n",
       " \"Good salespeople won't just work on commission either, so don't think you can just try someone out without any risk. If someone offers to work on sales for your small company without a salary, they may have an ulterior motive � like negotiating an ownership stake in your company. A salesperson you don't even know who offers to work for some percentage of your company is probably a scammer of some sort, and you should run away quickly. Remember your goal is to build a lifestyle business that maximizes your personal freedom. Being tied down by employees or partners that deliver questionable value is not a decision that should be taken lightly.\",\n",
       " \"Can you really find a salesperson that is knowledgeable about the specific niche your product targets? If not, they may end up doing more harm than good to your company's reputation. Within a small niche, that reputation can spread quickly.

It will probably earn more money in the long run than taking on extra freelance work. Adding new features to an existing product also won't present as much of a return as building a new product might. Not all of your new product ideas will succeed, but think like a venture capitalist� try as many good ideas as you can, and if you have enough, some of them will be hits. The key is to get them out to market as quickly as possible so you can try as many ideas as you can.\",\n",
       " 'Always think critically of the return on investment you are getting on your time. It is the one resource you cannot make more of; spending it wisely is the key to growing your business. You must find ways to minimize the time it takes to support your existing products, in order to free up time to create new ones. ',\n",
       " 'Support and expand your existing products only as long as they are profitable, and have new ones ready to take their place. To do this, you need to plan in advance for the decline of your products. It sounds pessimistic, but it is necessary. If you have agreements with your customers that promise support in perpetuity, you will never be able to discontinue that product. Make sure any end user license agreements and contracts are explicitly time-bound for any support you will provide. Otherwise, you won�t have time to develop and support new products that are more relevant to your evolving markets.',\n",
       " 'FINDING THE PEOPLE',\n",
       " 'If you do need to hire contractors, finding the right ones is crucial. A bad contractor can burn up thousands of dollars while accomplishing nothing, or building the wrong thing. You may have hired someone on the presumption that your time is more valuable than the rate you are paying them � but if you could have done what they are doing in a quarter of the time, then you aren�t coming out ahead.',\n",
       " 'Using referrals through LinkedIn or other social networks can help. If someone you trust has used a contractor successfully, that means a lot. For more routine tasks, there are websites like Elance that offer contractors with customer ratings you can look at.',\n",
       " 'However, still start carefully with a new contractor, regardless of how well they are recommended. Start with a very small, well-defined task, with a strict upper bound on the cost or number of hours you are willing to spend on it. Make sure this number is one you are comfortable potentially losing. If the contractor meets your expectations, you can start outsourcing larger tasks as your budget permits. If not, then you haven�t lost much. Take advantage of the flexible and temporary relationship of a contractor in order to try them out before committing to larger projects.',\n",
       " 'Make sure your contractors have a contract! Your lawyer can provide one, or there are many boilerplate contracts available on the web you can adapt to your needs. The important points are to be very clear on the deliverables, when they are due, when and how payment will be made, who owns the resulting intellectual property, and where the work will be performed. It must also be clear that the contractor is responsible for their own benefits and taxes and is using their own equipment. If you are providing equipment and/or a workplace for your contractors, the IRS may question if they are in fact employees instead � and that�s a headache you don�t need. In the US, remember to get a W9 form from them, so you�ll know how to fill out their 1099 form at tax time.',\n",

       " 'A good place to start is with your existing customers of your existing products. They already have a relationship with you� hopefully a positive one! If you can build more products that meet their needs, it will be a lot easier to sell them to existing customers than to find new ones. That can get your new product out of the gates running.',\n",
       " 'So, take a customer to lunch. Have a phone conversation. Send out an online survey. It\\'s OK to have them evaluate some product ideas of your own, but even better is just to ask them \"what problems keep you up at night?\" Those are the sorts of problems people shell out money to solve.',\n",
       " 'Not only can you build off your existing customer base to grow your business, you can also build off your existing products. Is there some aspect of the manufacturing or creation of your current products that would make it easy to create new ones? I did this with the software development kits my company sells� realizing that the market of software developers was relatively small, I used my own software to develop add-ons for a popular flight simulator game.  With a few months of effort, I was able to leverage the years that went into developing that software to create a highly competitive product for flight simulation enthusiasts. Today, this derivative product brings in over $100,000 per year in revenue� and the up-front costs were just a few months of my development effort.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps your company sells physical products, and the manufacturing, distribution, sales, and marketing you worked so hard to establish can be mostly re-used to sell another product. Find ways to leverage the initial development costs of your earlier products to bring new ones to market quickly and cheaply.',\n",
       " \"Are there new markets for your existing products you haven't considered? Perhaps a little bit of re-packaging is all you need. My software products were initially targeted toward developers of training and simulation systems. All it took was a weekend of caffeine-fueled coding to launch a variation of those products targeted to video game developers. That weekend of effort ended up generating about $1000 per month for years. Not huge money, but it was definitely a good return on the investment of my time. One hour that weekend created $1,800 over the following three years. Not a bad hourly pay rate!\",\n",
       " 'Finally, be open to completely new product ideas for completely new customers as well. Your company�s mission statement isn�t cast in stone � if new business opportunities present themselves, and you�re in a position to execute on them without risking much, why not? Sundog Software isn�t just selling software these days; it�s also experimenting with online courses in the areas I�m knowledgeable about, and selling books on starting a business! Both of those ideas came through my personal connections and networking efforts, along with the opportunity to try them out. I don�t know if they will pay off, but if they do, it could result in my company pivoting in a big way � with no initial cost other than some of my time.',\n",
       " 'THE COMPOUNDING EFFECT',\n",
       " \"You don't need to be an accounting genius to see how this mentality can lead to great rewards year after year. If every year you launch a new product that generates $100,000 per year� you'll be making a million dollars per year, every year, after ten years. That's much easier said than done; not all of your products will be a smashing success and revenue from older products will likely decline over time. But if you have the discipline to always be launching new products, they can create ongoing revenue streams for you that just keep adding together year after year. \",\n",
       " \"It takes hard work and diligence, but forcing yourself to find time to launch new product ideas is what leads to long-term wealth. Increasing the sales of an existing product by 20% can take a lot of work. Launching a new product that sells more than 20% of your existing product may be a lot easier. Even if you only achieve 20% growth every year� that's a much better return than you'd get from the stock market, or from pay raises in a corporate job.\",\n",
       " \"I don't want you leave this book thinking it's some sort of get-rich-quick scheme. In reality, solo-preneurs that earn over a million dollars per year are incredibly rare. I know exactly one, personally. All those new products take time to support, and there are only so many tasks you can outsource or automate. Your available time will ultimately place an upper bound on your earnings, not to mention the quality of your ideas and your ability to execute on every aspect of building them and promoting them. If you start hitting the wall of your own time, you need to decide whether to hire others to continue growing your business, or be content with maintaining the cash flow� and personal freedom� you have already achieved. That is what is known as a good problem to have.\",\n",
       " \" I do want you to leave this book understanding that working for yourself is a realistic path to a rich lifestyle. You don't need a million dollars per year to live as comfortably as you can reasonably imagine. A 2010 study by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman showed that income over $75,000 per year doesn�t actually increase personal happiness. Earning $75,000 per year from your own business is certainly an achievable goal� and you'll have all the benefits of being your own boss as well.\",\n",

You'll never look at corporate employment the same way again, and you'll enjoy a level of personal freedom you quite literally never knew existed.\",\n",

       " \"SURVIVOR'S GUILT\",\n",
       " \"Once you realize you're able to support yourself without the benefit of a big corporate employer, you'll probably be in a little bit of denial. Perhaps you spent decades in the service of others, trained to believe this was a virtuous thing to do. You worked hard to further your career, and then threw your career away. Were all of those years wasted? That's not something you want to believe, but you suspect it may be true.\",\n",
       " \"How can I face my friends who still have traditional jobs and see them in the same way? They want to talk about their work, but it just reminds you of a corporate career you no longer look back on fondly. Yet they remain all-consumed with their careers. You don't want to talk about how your life has changed too much, because it will feel like you're gloating.\",\n",

People learn by doing, and accomplishing that learning while someone else is paying you for it is not a bad deal. You would not be successful in your own business without the benefit of that learning experience that's behind you. Your only regret should be if you continued in the same job once it stopped offering new things to learn.\",\n",
       " \"Second, don't be afraid to talk to your friends about your new business. Answer their questions honestly. Getting to where you are now wasn't easy, and talking about that path isn't gloating.

You'll feel guilty when you take a break by the pool because you're mentally drained for the day, not because the clock says 5 PM. You'll feel guilty on the days when you earn more money from sales before breakfast than you used to in an entire day of work.
