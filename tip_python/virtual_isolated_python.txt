When it comes to make some Flask,
To specify only needed lib is important.
To do that, we need virtualenv



** How to install?
pip install virtualenv

** How to do it?
1. go to same directory level where app located
ex) mysite - d_website
           - virtual_env,
You should be at /mysite

2. python -m venv name
ex) python -m venv virtual

3. Then there is isonlated python.exe, pip.exe
which you can execute from there

4. With that isolated folder,
you can specify only needed lib

** How to execute?
path/python
path/pip install module

** Where is installed lib?
virtual/Lib/site-packages
